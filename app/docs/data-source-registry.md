# No-Auth Data Source Registry

## Purpose

This registry gives future 11Writer agents a vetted list of public, no-auth, machine-readable entry points that can be integrated without keys, logins, signup flows, email gates, request-access flows, or CAPTCHA bypassing.

This is a connector registry, not feature code. The authoritative machine-readable file is:

- `app/docs/data_sources.noauth.registry.json`

The consolidated human-readable candidate and rejection list is:

- `app/docs/source-consolidated-noauth-registry.md`

Connect AI owns this registry. Feature agents should consume it, not silently invent new production sources.

## Current repo context

Already in repo or already integrated enough to avoid duplicate connector work:

- `usgs-earthquakes`
- `nasa-eonet`
- `usgs-ashcam`

See also:

- `app/docs/environmental-events-earthquakes.md`
- `app/docs/environmental-events-eonet.md`
- `app/docs/webcams.md`

## Status model

- `tier-1-ready`: public no-auth entry point verified, machine-readable, and suitable for a narrow first implementation slice soon
- `tier-2-complex`: public no-auth entry point verified, but the first slice must stay narrow because the family is broad, binary-heavy, OGC-heavy, or operationally awkward
- `approved-candidate`: public no-auth entry point verified and reasonable for backend polling
- `needs-verification`: public docs exist, but the exact backend-safe entry point still needs tighter confirmation
- `deferred`: public and documented, but not a near-term fit or carries licensing, transport, or interpretation caveats
- `rejected`: should not be used under current project rules
- `already-integrated`: already shipped in repo
- `already-planned`: already assigned or intentionally queued elsewhere

Legacy entries may still use `defer` while older records are being normalized. New Phase 2 additions use the expanded status set above.

## Tier 1: Ready Soon

- `usgs-volcano-hazards`
  Why: official USGS API, no auth, GeoJSON/status outputs, strong environmental and aviation context value.
  First slice: elevated volcano status GeoJSON and advisory metadata.

- `noaa-tsunami-alerts`
  Why: official Tsunami.gov Atom and CAP feeds, clean polling shape, high coastal hazard value.
  First slice: alert records with center, issued time, severity, and bulletin link.

- `faa-nas-airport-status`
  Why: public FAA XML endpoint for active airport status events, directly useful to aerospace workflows.
  First slice: airport closure, ground stop, ground delay, arrival/departure delay normalization.

- `noaa-aviation-weather-center-data-api`
  Why: official NOAA AWC API with JSON and GeoJSON, broad aviation weather utility, documented rate limits.
  First slice: METAR plus SIGMET or G-AIRMET context for selected airports and routes.

- `noaa-coops-tides-currents`
  Why: official NOAA data API, stable JSON responses, strong marine and coastal utility.
  First slice: station water level or currents observations for selected viewport-adjacent stations.

- `noaa-ndbc-realtime`
  Why: official NOAA realtime flat files, simple HTTP pull, good buoy context with low implementation cost.
  First slice: station metadata plus latest buoy weather/wave observations for nearby stations.

- `usgs-water-services-iv`
  Why: official USGS Water Services JSON, easy no-auth pull, valuable river and flood context.
  First slice: instantaneous streamflow and gauge height by site id or nearby gauge shortlist.

- `noaa-swpc-space-weather`
  Why: official NOAA JSON product feeds, no auth, easy backend polling, clear aerospace context.
  First slice: alerts and planetary K-index summaries.

- `noaa-national-hurricane-center-gis-rss`
  Why: official NHC GIS RSS/XML feeds, strong coastal and marine value, proven machine-readable output.
  First slice: active basin advisory summaries and storm track/cone metadata links.

- `noaa-spc-products`
  Why: official SPC RSS family, useful severe-weather context, low integration cost for advisory records.
  First slice: outlook, watch, mesoscale discussion record ingestion without polygon rendering.

- `noaa-spc-storm-reports`
  Why: official SPC CSV, easy to ingest, directly useful as observed severe-weather context.
  First slice: today/yesterday report ingestion with preliminary flag preserved.

- `fema-openfema-disasters`
  Why: official read-only API, no auth, well-documented, useful administrative disaster context.
  First slice: DisasterDeclarationsSummaries by state, county, and FIPS.

- `cisa-kev-catalog`
  Why: official CISA JSON and CSV catalog, no auth, easy cyber/reference ingestion.
  First slice: KEV record indexing by CVE and due date, without geographic mapping.

## Tier 2: Useful But Complex

- `noaa-nexrad-level2`
- `noaa-mrms-products`
- `noaa-goes-glm-lightning`
- `ioos-hfradar-surface-currents`
- `noaa-nws-warning-mapservice`
- `nifc-wfigs-public-wildfire`
- `gdacs-public-feeds`
- `gebco-bathymetry`
- `noaa-etopo-global-relief`
- `gmrt-multires-topography`
- `emodnet-bathymetry`
- `hydrosheds-hydrorivers`
- `hydrosheds-hydrolakes`
- `grwl-river-widths`
- `glwd-wetlands`
- `isric-soilgrids`
- `fao-hwsd-soils`
- `esa-worldcover-landcover`

These are public and valuable, but the first slice should stay narrow:

- metadata/index discovery first
- overlay-first when appropriate
- fixture-first tests before any live viewport rendering
- no attempt to solve full binary raster or all-layer rendering in the first connector

Base-earth additions from Batch 7 are mostly static/reference rasters or large vectors. They are approved as source candidates, but first slices must use one version, one product family, one bounded AOI/point lookup, or one simplified regional extract.

## Tier 3: Future Or Conditional

- `noaa-national-water-prediction-service-api`
- `noaa-nowcoast-ogc-services`
- `minnesota-511-public-arcgis`
- `gdelt`
- `wikimedia-eventstream`
- `sans-isc-dshield-api`
- `abusech-urlhaus`
- `allen-coral-atlas-reefs`
- `usgs-tectonic-boundaries-reference`

These remain in the registry so future agents do not have to rediscover them, but they should not be treated as ready-soon production inputs.

Batch 7 notes:

- `allen-coral-atlas-reefs` remains `needs-verification` because public product descriptions are clear, but the normal Atlas download flow appears account-oriented and Earth Engine access requires registration. Promote only after a direct public no-auth download route is pinned.
- `usgs-tectonic-boundaries-reference` remains `needs-verification` because public-domain USGS maps are verified, but a stable global machine-readable GIS route was not pinned.

## Base-earth / geography backlog

Assignment-ready static/reference slices:

- `gshhg-shorelines`
- `natural-earth-physical`
- `glims-glacier-outlines`
- `rgi-glacier-inventory`
- `pb2002-plate-boundaries`
- `noaa-global-volcano-locations`
- `smithsonian-gvp-volcanoes`

Tier-2 complex static/raster/vector slices:

- `gebco-bathymetry`
- `noaa-etopo-global-relief`
- `gmrt-multires-topography`
- `emodnet-bathymetry`
- `hydrosheds-hydrorivers`
- `hydrosheds-hydrolakes`
- `grwl-river-widths`
- `glwd-wetlands`
- `isric-soilgrids`
- `fao-hwsd-soils`
- `esa-worldcover-landcover`

Detailed scope and guardrails:

- `app/docs/source-acceleration-phase2-batch7-base-earth-briefs.md`

## International backlog

Phase 2 adds an international backlog for public no-auth flood, weather, hydrology, transport, and space-hazard sources. The detailed planning file is:

- `app/docs/data-source-international-backlog.md`

Highest-confidence new international candidates:

- `uk-ea-flood-monitoring`
- `canada-cap-alerts`
- `dwd-cap-alerts`
- `geonet-geohazards`
- `copernicus-ems-rapid-mapping`
- `germany-autobahn-api`
- `hko-open-weather`
- `meteoswiss-open-data`
- `scottish-water-overflows`
- `nasa-jpl-cneos`

## Data AI RSS backlog

Data AI has a dedicated RSS/Atom candidate list for cybersecurity, internet infrastructure, world news, and world events:

- `app/docs/data-ai-rss-source-candidates.md`
- `app/docs/data-ai-rss-source-candidates-batch2.md`
- `app/docs/data-ai-rss-source-candidates-batch3.md`

Validated working feeds found in the first pass:

- 52 RSS/Atom/RDF feeds
- 115 additional Batch 2 RSS/Atom/RDF feeds
- 110 additional Batch 3 RSS/Atom/RDF feeds
- 277 total validated Data AI feed candidates

First implementation should not enable all feeds at once. Start with:

- `cisa-cybersecurity-advisories`
- `cisa-ics-advisories`
- `sans-isc-diary`
- `cloudflare-status`
- `gdacs-alerts`

Data AI feed rules:

- fixture-first parser before runtime polling
- preserve feed provenance, final URL, timestamps, source health, and caveats
- treat media/blog/vendor feeds as contextual awareness unless the source itself is the authoritative actor for the event
- do not scrape linked article pages without separate source approval

## Rejected / Avoid

- `marinetraffic-scrape`
- `vesselfinder-scrape`
- `openphish-phishtank-unvetted`
- `generic-all-state-dot-feeds`
- `viewer-only-web-apps-no-stable-endpoint`
- `restricted-login-key-email-captcha-sources`
- `restricted-nifc-egp-login-datasets`
- `utility-outage-maps-unverified`

- `noaa-national-water-prediction-service-api`

### Features / webcam

Best next options:

- `minnesota-511-public-arcgis` only after separate verification
- `noaa-nws-warning-mapservice`
- `noaa-nowcoast-ogc-services`
- `nifc-wfigs-public-wildfire`

Important boundary:

- many existing 511 camera sources in `app/docs/webcams.md` are credentialed and therefore outside this no-auth registry unless individually re-vetted as public no-auth machine endpoints

### Reference

Best next options:

- `fema-openfema-disasters`
- `cisa-kev-catalog`
- `faa-nas-airport-status`
- `usgs-water-services-iv`

Reference agents should enrich canonical entities without overwriting reviewed links or claiming stronger identity certainty than the source supports.

### Connect AI

Primary duties:

- maintain this registry
- verify no-auth status
- record rate and access caveats
- provide fixture-first connector prompts
- downgrade any source whose terms or access behavior changes

## Maintenance rules

- Connect AI owns this registry and GitHub-facing hygiene around it.
- Feature agents may request sources from this registry, but should not add unvetted live sources directly to production code.
- Every new connector must be fixture-first and should make live access optional.
- Every new connector should preserve provenance and keep observed, inferred, derived, scored, and contextual outputs separate.
- If a source adds auth, CAPTCHA, key requirements, request-access steps, or unstable anti-bot behavior, downgrade it to `needs-verification` or `rejected`.

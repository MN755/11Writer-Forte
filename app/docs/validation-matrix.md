# Validation Matrix

## Purpose

This guide provides task-scoped validation commands for the active 11Writer worktree. Use it before staging or committing a single task group from:

- `app/docs/commit-groups.current.md`

For a larger pre-commit advisory scan, use:

- `python scripts/release_dry_run.py`
- `python scripts/validation_snapshot.py --compile passed --lint passed --build passed --smoke marine=passed --smoke aerospace=known-local-caveat:windows-browser-launch-permission --smoke webcam=passed`
- `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py`
- `app/docs/source-fusion-reporting-input-inventory.md`
- `app/docs/phase3-handoffs/connect-ai.md`

Commands are written for the current Windows environment and prefer explicit working directories plus `cmd /c npm.cmd ...` for client commands.

The product target is cross-platform: full desktop app, companion web app, and backend-only runtime across Windows 10/11, macOS, and Linux. A Windows-only validation pass is local evidence, not proof of cross-platform support. Any task that touches runtime modes, packaging, storage paths, service/daemon behavior, companion access, network binding, or desktop shell behavior must also define the OS-native validation still required before support is claimed.

## Existing command entry points inspected

- Root:
  - no root `package.json` found
- Client:
  - `app/client/package.json`
  - available scripts:
    - `npm run lint`
    - `npm run build`
    - `npm run dev`
    - `npm run preview`
- Server and docs:
  - `app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py`
  - `app/server/tests/smoke_fixture_app.py`
  - `app/docs/repo-workflow.md`
  - domain docs that already reference focused smoke or test subsets

## General rules

- Run only the validations that match the task group you are staging.
- Do not treat a Windows Playwright browser launch failure as an automatic feature failure on this machine.
- For docs-only changes, prefer diff review over broad builds.
- For shared files, validate after hunk staging, not before.
- Current verified machine state: `python -m compileall app/server/src`, `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`, and `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` are green; focused `marine` and `webcam` smoke currently pass, while focused `aerospace` smoke currently fails before app assertions with `windows-playwright-launch-permission`, narrowed to `windows-browser-launch-permission`.
- That pre-assertion aerospace smoke result does not imply stale `dist` output or a current client compile failure.
- Current verified Marine helper checkpoint is also green:
  - `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_marine_contracts.py app/server/tests/test_netherlands_rws_waterinfo.py app/server/tests/test_vigicrues_hydrometry.py app/server/tests/test_ireland_opw_waterlevel.py -q`
  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run test:marine-context-helpers`
  - the current `2026-05-04 21:06 America/Chicago` run passed with `71` backend tests plus a clean client helper regression check
- Current verified Atlas operator-console shared-boundary checkpoint is green:
  - `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_source_discovery_memory.py app/server/tests/test_wave_monitor.py -q`
  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`
  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`
  - the current `2026-05-04 21:43 America/Chicago` run passed with `52` backend tests plus a clean client lint/build pass
  - treat this as shared-boundary validation only, not full operator workflow proof
- Current verified consolidation-readiness checkpoint is also green at the validation level:
  - the current `2026-05-05 20:22 America/Chicago` bounded source-wave integration pass also stayed green for:
    - `python -m compileall app/server/src`
    - `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`
    - `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`
    - `python scripts/list_changed_files_by_owner.py --summary`
    - `python scripts/release_dry_run.py --json`
    - `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json`
  - this pass did not reproduce a shared type or route-contract break
  - it did reduce ownership ambiguity for the new user-priority source wave:
    - Data AI: `cisa-kev`, `rdap`, `crtsh`, and the bounded `internet_context` route family
    - Geospatial: `nws-alerts` and `noaa-nowcoast-ogc`
    - Aerospace: `gpsjam`
    - Features/Webcam: OSM lead-discovery and lead-review-reconciliation packets
    - Gather: `source-user-priority-routing-governance-packet.md`
  - keep the remaining Source Discovery runtime/eval slice explicitly broad/shared rather than forcing it into a lane-local commit group
  - the current `2026-05-05 19:15 America/Chicago` shared reporting-loop contract pass stayed green after one syntax-only compile fix for `source_discovery_service.py`:
    - `python -m compileall app/server/src`
    - `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`
    - `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`
    - `cmd /c npm.cmd run test:reporting-loop-package-contract`
    - `python scripts/validation_snapshot.py --compile passed --lint passed --build passed`
  - the focused shared compatibility surface now validates:
    - Aerospace fusion snapshot, report brief, current-awareness digest, VAAC advisory report package, and reporting handoff contract
    - Data AI fusion snapshot, report brief, current-awareness digest, topic-safe report export packet, and question briefing packet
    - Marine fusion snapshot, report brief, and current-awareness digest
  - keep this as compatibility validation only:
    - no domain semantics rewrites
    - no fake normalization that erases differences between advisory, digest, handoff, and export packet shapes
  - keep Source Discovery public-web workflow, archive scans, mailing-list adapters, regional-portal scans, Stack Exchange, seed packets, Statuspage, Mastodon, and media geolocation explicitly below source-validation proof anywhere they appear in shared compatibility notes
  - the current `2026-05-05 19:01 America/Chicago` breadth/current-awareness checkpoint stayed green for:
    - `python -m compileall app/server/src`
    - `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`
    - `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`
    - `cmd /c npm.cmd run test:reporting-loop-package-contract`
    - `python scripts/validation_snapshot.py --compile passed --lint passed --build passed`
  - the remaining broad/shared files in that pass were:
    - `app/docs/source-discovery-public-web-workflow.md`
    - `app/server/src/routes/source_discovery.py`
    - `app/server/src/services/source_discovery_service.py`
    - `app/server/src/types/source_discovery.py`
    - `app/server/tests/test_source_discovery_memory.py`
  - keep those Source Discovery public-web and runtime surfaces explicitly below source-validation proof
  - keep Wonder archive-index, mailing-list archive, directory-root, Stack Exchange, Statuspage, and Mastodon discovery in candidate/review/runtime posture only
  - keep Wonder seed-packet lineage as explainability metadata only
  - keep Atlas media geolocation in derived-evidence/runtime-quality posture only
  - the current `2026-05-05 09:47 America/Chicago` reporting-loop package-contract pass also stayed green for:
    - `python -m compileall app/server/src`
    - `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`
    - `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`
    - `cmd /c npm.cmd run test:reporting-loop-package-contract`
    - `python scripts/validation_snapshot.py --compile passed --lint passed --build passed`
  - this pass also added `app/docs/reporting-loop-package-contract.md` as the neutral compatibility contract for current fusion-snapshot and report-brief surfaces
  - backend environmental fusion snapshot input remains validated on its own server route test rather than through the new client regression
  - the current `2026-05-04 23:26 America/Chicago` fusion/reporting-input pass also stayed green for:
    - `python -m compileall app/server/src`
    - `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`
    - `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`
    - `python scripts/validation_snapshot.py --compile passed --lint passed --build passed`
  - that pass created `app/docs/source-fusion-reporting-input-inventory.md` so shared reporting/fusion surfaces can be deconflicted without rereading every lane
  - the stale-vs-real `AppShell.tsx` mismatch pattern reported by Data AI did not reproduce in the live tree
  - `python -m compileall app/server/src`
  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`
  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`
  - `python scripts/validation_snapshot.py --compile passed --lint passed --build passed`
  - the current `2026-05-04 22:11 America/Chicago` release-dry-run posture is still not consolidation-green because the tree remains mixed and `release_dry_run.py --json` reports advisory red flags plus a nonzero exit
  - current shared-surface occupancy means new work must inspect existing review/export/intake packages before adding another helper:
    - aerospace evidence timeline and review/export bundles already exist in shared shell/inspector/types
    - webcam candidate/review/export contracts already exist in shared queries/types and smoke fixtures
    - environmental review/export packages already exist in shared server API contracts
    - Data AI, Source Discovery, Wave LLM, and analyst review/timeline contracts already exist in shared query/type layers
- Current verified Source Discovery plus Wave LLM shared-runtime checkpoint is also green:
  - `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_source_discovery_memory.py app/server/tests/test_wave_monitor.py app/server/tests/test_analyst_workbench.py -q`
  - the current `2026-05-04 22:59 America/Chicago` run passed with `76` backend tests
  - one earlier scheduler-response validation failure appeared once in the same assignment with `publicDiscoveryJobsCompleted` reported missing, but immediate route/service inspection plus a direct route repro showed the live tree already returns that field and the full suite reran cleanly with no source edit
  - `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_source_discovery_memory.py -q`
  - `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_wave_monitor.py app/server/tests/test_analyst_workbench.py -q`
  - `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_data_ai_multi_feed.py app/server/tests/test_rss_feed_service.py -q`
  - `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_camera_sandbox_validation_report.py app/server/tests/test_webcam_module.py -q`
  - `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_ourairports_reference_contracts.py -q`
  - current warning posture in that checkpoint:
    - current `2026-05-02 15:45 America/Chicago` run did not emit a warning summary line for these suites
    - earlier Source Discovery and Wave Monitor checkpoints did emit non-blocking Pydantic warning noise
  - treat current live warnings posture as non-blocking but still worth future cleanup if warning summaries reappear.

## Connect / tooling

Purpose:

- docs, workflow, smoke preflight, and harness coordination

Working directory:

- repo root: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer`

Commands:

```bash
python -m py_compile app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py
git diff -- app/docs/repo-workflow.md app/docs/active-agent-worktree.md app/docs/commit-groups.current.md app/docs/validation-matrix.md
git diff --stat
```

Notes:

- If the staged scope is docs-only, stop at diff review.
- If the staged scope is a Phase 2 to Phase 3 handoff-only pass, use `app/docs/phase3-handoffs/connect-ai.md` plus current `git status`, ownership summary, and alerts truth instead of rerunning compile/lint/build unless executable/shared runtime files changed.
- Do not run Playwright unless Connect is explicitly assigned to smoke execution.
- If the staged scope includes runtime operator-console surfaces, also validate:
  - `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_source_discovery_memory.py app/server/tests/test_wave_monitor.py -q`
  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`
  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`
- If the staged scope is a consolidation-readiness sweep, also run:
  - `python scripts/list_changed_files_by_owner.py --summary`
  - `python scripts/release_dry_run.py --json`
  - `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json`
  - if current counts are much smaller than older checkpoint docs, treat the older `100+ changed file` snapshots as historical mixed-wave truth unless the scanner itself is currently broken
  - rerun the ownership summary if active lane edits land during the same sweep; repo-truth can move materially while the branch still stays validation-green
  - if one build or lint failure appears but the current file state immediately contradicts it, rerun the failing command before editing to avoid stale-fix churn in a moving mixed tree
  - inspect the current shared occupancy in `AppShell.tsx`, `InspectorPanel.tsx`, `queries.ts`, `api.ts`, `api.py`, `settings.py`, and `smoke_fixture_app.py` before authoring new queue/export/timeline helpers
  - if the staged scope touches the reporting-desk / fusion-input wave, inspect `app/docs/source-fusion-reporting-input-inventory.md` first so you extend existing bounded packages instead of minting duplicate helpers with overlapping semantics
  - if the staged scope touches incoming source-wave intake, inspect `app/docs/source-onboarding-contract.md` first so auth posture, machine-usability posture, fixture-first expectations, cache/request-budget posture, and prompt-injection-safe free-text handling stay consistent
  - if the staged scope touches shared reporting-loop packages, also inspect `app/docs/reporting-loop-package-contract.md` and run:
    - `cmd /c npm.cmd run test:reporting-loop-package-contract`
    - keep backend environmental fusion snapshot coverage on `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_environmental_fusion_snapshot_input.py -q`
    - treat backend webcam sandbox/source-ops reporting helpers as adjacent reporting/support surfaces unless they explicitly grow stable reporting-loop semantics
    - keep Wonder Stack Exchange and seed-packet discovery in candidate/review discovery posture only
    - keep Atlas media geolocation and Wonder Statuspage or Mastodon discovery in candidate/review/derived-evidence/runtime posture unless separate controlled validation promotes them
  - if the staged scope includes `geoboundaries-admin`, validate it as bounded geospatial reference context only:
    - `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_geoboundaries_admin.py -q`
    - keep `geoboundaries-admin` below legal-jurisdiction truth, operational-control truth, and live-incident proof
  - if the staged scope includes `meteoalarm-atom-feeds`, validate it as bounded advisory/contextual warning-distribution context only:
    - `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_meteoalarm_atom_feed.py -q`
    - keep one bounded country feed at a time
    - keep Meteoalarm below national-provider authority, impact proof, and action guidance
  - if the staged scope includes the Aerospace selected-target operational-question packet regression, treat it as aerospace export/reporting compatibility only:
    - `cmd /c npm.cmd run test:reporting-loop-package-contract`
    - do not let the packet language imply intent, route consequence, threat, or action recommendation
  - if the staged scope touches `source_discovery.py`, `source_discovery_service.py`, `types/source_discovery.py`, or `test_source_discovery_memory.py`, keep them explicitly shared/runtime-scoped unless Manager AI or the user has provided a narrower durable owner
  - if Data AI routing docs are part of the staged scope, prefer the newer routing truth in `app/docs/source-prompt-index.md`, `app/docs/data-ai-next-routing-after-family-summary.md`, `app/docs/source-ownership-consumption-map.md`, and `app/docs/source-routing-priority-memo.md`; older packet/history docs may still contain superseded `propublica` / `global-voices` suggestions

## Shared reporting-loop package contract

Purpose:

- neutral compatibility validation for current fusion-snapshot inputs and report-brief packages

Working directory:

- client: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\client`
- repo root: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer`

Commands:

```bash
cd C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\client
cmd /c npm.cmd run test:reporting-loop-package-contract

cd C:\Users\mike\11Writer
python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_environmental_fusion_snapshot_input.py -q
```

Notes:

- Use this block when staged changes touch:
  - `app/docs/reporting-loop-package-contract.md`
  - `app/docs/source-fusion-reporting-input-inventory.md`
  - `app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceReportBriefPackage.ts`
  - `app/client/src/features/inspector/dataAiSourceIntelligence.ts`
  - `app/client/src/features/marine/marineFusionSnapshotInput.ts`
  - `app/client/src/features/marine/marineReportBriefPackage.ts`
  - `app/server/src/routes/environmental_context.py`
  - shared API contracts tied to those package surfaces
- The client regression is compatibility-only:
  - it checks minimum lineage, caveat, does-not-prove, review/attention, export-safe, and section-presence requirements
  - it also checks the Aerospace VAAC advisory report package as an adjacent reporting/support package that preserves lineage without pretending to be a full report-brief section bundle
  - it does not rewrite package semantics into one exact schema
  - backend webcam sandbox/source-ops reporting helpers remain documented as adjacent reporting/support surfaces, not first-class reporting-loop peers

## Shared source onboarding contract

Purpose:

- shared intake/onboarding contract for incoming no-auth source waves

Working directory:

- repo root: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer`

Commands:

```bash
git diff -- app/docs/source-onboarding-contract.md app/docs/source-ownership-consumption-map.md app/docs/source-validation-status.md app/docs/source-fusion-reporting-input-inventory.md app/docs/reporting-desk-phase2-roadmap.md
python scripts/list_changed_files_by_owner.py --summary
python scripts/release_dry_run.py --json
python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json
```

Notes:

- use this block when staged changes only tighten shared onboarding, intake, or validation-support rules
- this block is docs-only unless Connect explicitly changes a shared scanner or validator script
- keep browser-only, discovery-only, runtime-only, and derived-evidence surfaces below implementation proof in any onboarding edits

## Gather / source registry

Purpose:

- no-auth source registry docs and JSON only

Working directory:

- repo root: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer`

Commands:

```bash
python -m json.tool app/docs/data_sources.noauth.registry.json
git diff -- app/docs/data-source-backlog.md app/docs/data-source-integration-rules.md app/docs/data-source-registry.md app/docs/data_sources.noauth.registry.json
```

Notes:

- No broad client or backend build is needed unless source code changed.

## Data AI

Purpose:

- bounded public internet-information source slices, cyber-context routes, and the first five-feed aggregate route

Working directory:

- repo root: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer`

Commands:

```bash
python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_cisa_cyber_advisories.py app/server/tests/test_first_epss.py -q
python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_data_ai_multi_feed.py -q
python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_rss_feed_service.py -q
python -m compileall app/server/src
```

Notes:

- Keep lane validation bounded to the assigned Data AI source slice.
- Do not treat the generic RSS foundation as lane-exclusive ownership just because Data AI currently consumes it.
- If the change only touches Data AI docs, prefer diff review plus the focused backend tests above.

## Source Discovery / Wave LLM shared runtime boundary

Purpose:

- shared runtime, review, scheduler, candidate-memory, and LLM-boundary validation across Connect, Data AI, Wave Monitor, and Analyst surfaces

Working directory:

- repo root: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer`

Commands:

```bash
python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_source_discovery_memory.py -q
python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_wave_monitor.py app/server/tests/test_analyst_workbench.py -q
python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_data_ai_multi_feed.py app/server/tests/test_rss_feed_service.py -q
python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_camera_sandbox_validation_report.py app/server/tests/test_webcam_module.py -q
python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_ourairports_reference_contracts.py -q
python -m compileall app/server/src
```

Notes:

- Use this block when staged changes touch any of:
  - `app/server/src/app.py`
  - `app/server/src/routes/source_discovery.py`
  - `app/server/src/routes/wave_llm.py`
  - `app/server/src/services/runtime_scheduler_service.py`
  - `app/server/src/services/source_discovery_service.py`
  - `app/server/src/services/wave_llm_service.py`
  - `app/server/src/services/wave_monitor_service.py`
  - `app/server/src/types/source_discovery.py`
  - `app/server/src/types/wave_monitor.py`
  - `app/server/tests/test_source_discovery_memory.py`
  - `app/server/tests/test_wave_monitor.py`
  - `app/server/tests/test_analyst_workbench.py`
  - `app/server/src/services/media_evidence_service.py`
  - `app/server/src/services/wave_llm_provider_config_service.py`
- Current boundary truth for this block:
  - catalog scan is bounded, candidate-only, and explicit through `POST /api/source-discovery/jobs/catalog-scan`
  - structure scan, public-discovery follow-ups, and knowledge-backfill are implemented bounded runtime surfaces; they enrich candidate/review lineage but do not prove event truth
  - article fetch is explicit through `POST /api/source-discovery/jobs/article-fetch` and is gated to reviewed source classes plus allowed lifecycle states
  - social metadata collection is explicit through `POST /api/source-discovery/jobs/social-metadata`, stores metadata-only snapshots, and does not fetch private or media-heavy payloads
  - source packet export is explicit through `GET /api/source-discovery/memory/{source_id}/export`
  - media artifact fetch, OCR, and interpretation paths now exist as bounded and gated services; they remain public-source/media-evidence scaffolding rather than autonomous ingestion proof
  - reviewed-claim application is explicit through `POST /api/source-discovery/reviews/apply-claims`, requires reviewed input, and is audit-logged
  - runtime worker control is explicit through `POST /api/source-discovery/runtime/workers/{worker_name}/control`
  - manual `run_now` is lease-safe and may return skip states when another worker holds the current lease
  - scheduler startup loops are opt-in and gated by both `*_SCHEDULER_ENABLED` and `*_SCHEDULER_RUN_ON_STARTUP`
  - scheduler ticks are bounded maintenance only and do not auto-promote, auto-validate, auto-activate, apply claims without review, or silently trust model output
  - scheduler-created Wave LLM tasks are review-only `article_claim_extraction` tasks from eligible snapshots
  - feed-link scan, bounded expansion, content snapshots, and review actions remain explicit job or review APIs
  - capability responses disclose provider configuration presence by key-source name only and must not expose secret values
  - live OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic, xAI, Google, OpenClaw, and Ollama execution remain gated by provider config, explicit network permission, and positive request budget
  - mock-model paths keep provider tests deterministic and do not require live provider calls
  - Wave LLM output remains review metadata and cannot directly change source reputation, source health, connector activation, source lifecycle truth, or trusted facts

## Geospatial backend

Purpose:

- environmental routes, services, fixtures, backend contracts

Working directory:

- server: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\server`

Commands:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_eonet_events.py -q
python -m pytest tests/test_earthquake_events.py -q
python -m pytest tests/test_planet_config.py -q
python -m compileall src
```

Notes:

- Use this block when staging backend-only environmental changes.
- If shared contract files are included, review matching frontend types before commit.

## Geospatial frontend / environmental

Purpose:

- environmental layers, overview helpers, shared frontend state and queries when required

Working directories:

- server: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\server`
- client: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\client`

Commands:

```bash
cd C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\server
python -m pytest tests/test_eonet_events.py -q
python -m pytest tests/test_earthquake_events.py -q
python -m pytest tests/test_planet_config.py -q
python -m compileall src

cd C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\client
cmd /c npm.cmd run lint
cmd /c npm.cmd run build
```

Notes:

- If `AppShell.tsx`, `LayerPanel.tsx`, `InspectorPanel.tsx`, `store.ts`, or `queries.ts` are included, review hunks manually before staging.
- Base Earth / environmental reference export and review packages are now part of the same reporting-input wave as client environmental context. Treat `base_earth_context.py`, `rgi_glacier_inventory_service.py`, and their shared API contracts as reporting inputs, not just isolated backend helpers.

## Aerospace

Purpose:

- aircraft and satellite workflow changes

Working directory:

- client: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\client`

Commands:

```bash
cmd /c npm.cmd run lint
cmd /c npm.cmd run build
```

Optional smoke:

```bash
cd C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\server
python tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace
```

Notes:

- Only run focused aerospace smoke where Playwright browser launch is known-good.
- On this Windows machine, browser launch failure may reflect tooling, not aerospace behavior.

## Marine

Purpose:

- vessel replay, anomaly workflows, evidence interpretation, marine UI support

Working directories:

- repo root: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer`
- client: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\client`

Commands:

```bash
python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_marine_contracts.py -q
python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_netherlands_rws_waterinfo.py app/server/tests/test_vigicrues_hydrometry.py app/server/tests/test_ireland_opw_waterlevel.py -q

cd C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\client
cmd /c npm.cmd run test:marine-context-helpers
cmd /c npm.cmd run lint
cmd /c npm.cmd run build
```

Optional focused smoke:

```bash
cd C:\Users\mike\11Writer
python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py marine
```

Notes:

- Treat marine-only smoke as focused validation when browser launch is healthy.
- If full smoke fails due unrelated launch or aerospace issues, do not classify that as automatic marine failure.

## Features / webcam

Purpose:

- camera operations, clustering, webcam state and docs

Working directories:

- repo root: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer`
- client: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\client`

Commands:

```bash
python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_reference_module.py app/server/tests/test_webcam_module.py -q
python -m compileall app/server/src app/server/tests/smoke_fixture_app.py

cd C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\client
cmd /c npm.cmd run lint
cmd /c npm.cmd run build
```

Optional focused smoke:

```bash
cd C:\Users\mike\11Writer
python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py webcam
```

Notes:

- Webcam smoke remains optional and environment-dependent.
- If local webcam smoke fails before assertions with `windows-playwright-launch-permission`, use another machine/environment or a manual browser check for source-specific smoke follow-up.

## Shared smoke harness

Purpose:

- `playwright_smoke.mjs`
- `run_playwright_smoke.py`
- `smoke_fixture_app.py`

Working directory:

- repo root: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer`

Commands:

```bash
python -m py_compile app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py
git diff -- app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py app/server/tests/smoke_fixture_app.py
```

Focused smoke phases that may be used later:

```bash
python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py marine
python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace
python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py earthquake
python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py eonet
python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py webcam
```

Playwright environment note:

- Known local classification: `windows-playwright-launch-permission`
- Current narrowed local cause for the focused aerospace smoke failure: `windows-browser-launch-permission`
- On this Windows machine, browser-launch failure is an environment and tooling issue, not automatically a feature failure.
- Non-Connect agents should not chase launch-permission issues unless explicitly assigned.
- Focused smoke phases may still be validated elsewhere.
- A pre-assertion smoke failure on this machine does not mean the current client build is stale if `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` already passed.

## Shared shell / panel / store reconciliation

Purpose:

- shared frontend files staged by hunk across multiple agent lanes

Working directory:

- client: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\client`

Commands:

```bash
git diff -- app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx app/client/src/features/layers/LayerPanel.tsx app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx app/client/src/lib/store.ts app/client/src/lib/queries.ts app/client/src/styles/global.css app/client/src/types/api.ts app/client/src/types/entities.ts
cd C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\client
cmd /c npm.cmd run lint
cmd /c npm.cmd run build
```

Notes:

- Run build and lint only after the staged hunk set is coherent.
- Do not auto-stage these files into a domain commit.

## Full local sanity check

Purpose:

- broader local confidence pass after several task groups have been consolidated

Working directories:

- server: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\server`
- client: `C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\client`

Commands:

```bash
cd C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\server
python -m pytest tests/test_eonet_events.py -q
python -m pytest tests/test_earthquake_events.py -q
python -m pytest tests/test_planet_config.py -q
python -m pytest tests/test_marine_contracts.py -q
python -m pytest tests/test_reference_module.py tests/test_webcam_module.py -q
python -m compileall src

cd C:\Users\mike\11Writer\app\client
cmd /c npm.cmd run lint
cmd /c npm.cmd run build
```

Notes:

- This is not required for every small docs-only or backend-only commit.
- Use it after multiple commit groups have been reconciled or before a larger push.

## Future script proposal

Possible future helper:

- `scripts/validate_task.py`

Suggested behavior:

- accept a task group name from `commit-groups.current.md`
- print or run the mapped validation commands
- stay read-only with no staging or git mutation behavior

Status:

- proposed only
- not implemented in this pass

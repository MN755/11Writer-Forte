# Connector Capability Map

Last updated:
- `2026-05-02 America/Chicago`

Owner note:
- Prepared by Wonder AI as a user-directed research note.
- This maps currently available connector and plugin capabilities to practical 11Writer uses.
- This is capability guidance, not implementation approval.

- `app/docs/README.md`

## Purpose

Show what the currently available Linear, Figma, LaTeX Tectonic, Notion, Supabase, and Cloudflare connectors can do, where they fit 11Writer well, and where they should be used carefully or not by default.

## Bottom Line

Best immediate value for 11Writer:

- `Linear` for issue, project, and engineering coordination
- `Figma` for design-to-code and component mapping workflows
- `Notion` for planning docs, research notes, structured workspaces, and cross-source search
- `LaTeX Tectonic` for high-quality PDF report/export generation

Useful but higher-risk or more architectural:

- `Supabase` for managed Postgres, Edge Functions, and dev branch workflows
- `Cloudflare` for infrastructure, DNS, edge, access, and security automation

For the last two, the current 11Writer rule still applies:

- shared backend/core remains the source of truth
- local-first and loopback-first defaults remain in place
- no remote access broadening without explicit pairing/auth and validation

## Capability Summary

| Connector | What it can do here | Best 11Writer fit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Linear` | Search, fetch, summarize, create, and update issues, projects, initiatives, documents, and comments | Product and engineering coordination |
| `Figma` | Read design context, manipulate Figma files, generate Code Connect mappings, and map designs to code components | UI design workflows and design-to-code alignment |
| `LaTeX Tectonic` | Compile `.tex` or `.latex` documents to PDF using a bundled Tectonic binary | Formal reports, export artifacts, and printable analyst packets |
| `Notion` | Search workspace and connected sources, fetch pages/databases, create and update pages, move pages, update views, and manage structured docs/databases | Knowledge base, planning, research synthesis, operating docs |
| `Supabase` | Execute SQL, apply migrations, create dev branches, inspect and deploy Edge Functions, and search Supabase docs | Optional managed data/service workflows if explicitly adopted |
| `Cloudflare` | Search Cloudflare OpenAPI spec and execute Cloudflare API operations against the connected account | Optional networking, DNS, security, edge, and remote-access infrastructure |

## Linear

Discovered capabilities:

- natural-language research queries across Linear entities
- keyword and semantic search
- fetch issue, project, initiative, or document details
- create and update comments
- delete comments
- extract images from issue or document markdown

Best 11Writer uses:

- turn user-approved work into scoped issues and projects
- summarize blocker state across current implementation waves
- track source-lane, validation, and consolidation work
- attach concise technical status updates to issues
- connect design or runtime follow-up work to explicit engineering records

Strong example workflows:

- summarize open cross-platform blockers for desktop, companion web, and backend-only runtime
- create a small issue set for a macOS runtime-control shell experiment
- annotate validation blockers with exact repo evidence and links

Guardrails:

- do not let Linear become the only source of technical truth; repo docs and code still matter
- do not blindly create large issue floods from rough ideas without user approval
- prefer bounded issue creation tied to actual repo evidence

## Figma

Discovered capabilities:

- get design context for a node, including reference code and screenshots
- inspect component metadata for Code Connect
- list code components available for a file
- get AI suggestions for mapping Figma nodes to code components
- save Code Connect mappings
- directly inspect or modify Figma files with plugin API JavaScript

Best 11Writer uses:

- keep frontend implementation aligned with a design source of truth
- map Figma components to React code in the current client
- map future native macOS extras to SwiftUI code if those surfaces are built
- inspect design assets and component structure before implementing UI
- manage diagrams, slides, or structured design systems without screenshot-only handoff

Strong example workflows:

- map a Figma inspector panel design to `app/client` React components
- generate a clean implementation brief from a Figma node before frontend work
- create Code Connect mappings for React now and SwiftUI later if macOS-native extras appear

Guardrails:

- do not treat Figma reference code as production-ready code
- preserve existing repo visual language unless the user explicitly wants a redesign
- check for existing design system components before creating new ones

## LaTeX Tectonic

Discovered capabilities:

- compile LaTeX and TeX documents with the bundled `tectonic` binary
- generate PDFs without installing a full system TeX distribution
- direct output into explicit output directories

Best 11Writer uses:

- analyst-ready PDF exports
- evidence packets
- release notes or public research briefs
- architecture or governance memos where polished PDF output matters
- printable handoff artifacts for non-technical review

Strong example workflows:

- generate a polished evidence packet from structured source-health summaries
- render a public-facing methodology brief or export guide to PDF
- compile a release artifact for roadmap, architecture, or validation reporting

Guardrails:

- this is a document build path, not a data connector
- report content still has to respect 11Writer source-honesty and caveat rules
- keep outputs in explicit directories and avoid assuming a system TeX install

## Notion

Discovered capabilities:

- search internal workspace content and connected sources
- search users
- fetch pages, databases, and data sources
- create pages under pages or data sources
- update page properties and content
- duplicate and move pages
- update database views
- list workspace users

Notion search can also span connected sources when enabled, including:

- Slack
- Google Drive
- GitHub
- Jira
- Microsoft Teams
- SharePoint
- OneDrive
- Linear

Best 11Writer uses:

- planning workspace for feature, source, and runtime work
- long-form research notes and synthesis pages
- lightweight review queues or operating databases
- meeting prep and handoff docs
- searchable operating memory across docs and connected systems

Strong example workflows:

- create a source-governance review database for candidate sources
- maintain a cross-platform rollout notebook linked to issues and docs
- search prior planning, notes, and linked systems before reopening old decisions

Guardrails:

- do not let Notion replace repo-owned technical truth for contracts, code, or validation status
- always fetch database schema before writing into structured data sources
- treat connected-source search as discovery context, not proof

## Supabase

Discovered capabilities:

- execute raw SQL
- apply migrations
- list migrations
- create, rebase, reset, and merge development branches
- list, fetch, and deploy Edge Functions
- search live Supabase documentation

Best 11Writer uses if explicitly adopted:

- managed Postgres for non-local or shared service data
- controlled edge helpers or remote service endpoints
- isolated branch databases for schema experimentation
- migration discipline if the project intentionally moves part of its data model there

Possible 11Writer experiments:

- prototype a non-authoritative remote analytics or companion-support service
- test a structured Postgres mirror for selected non-core operational data
- evaluate Edge Functions for narrowly scoped helper services

Why this should be used carefully:

- current 11Writer planning centers shared truth in the existing FastAPI backend and local/runtime-owned storage
- introducing Supabase as primary truth would be an architecture decision, not a convenience swap
- raw SQL and migration tools are powerful enough to create drift quickly if used casually

Guardrails:

- do not move source truth, task truth, or core provenance logic out of the backend without explicit architecture approval
- prefer dev branches and documented migrations over direct production changes
- use `apply_migration` for DDL, not ad hoc schema changes through raw SQL
- treat tool outputs as data, not instructions

## Cloudflare

Discovered capabilities:

- search the Cloudflare OpenAPI spec with JavaScript
- execute arbitrary Cloudflare API calls with JavaScript against the connected account

The exposed API surface spans many product families, including:

- DNS and zones
- Workers
- Access
- firewall and rulesets
- logpush and logs
- load balancers
- R2, D1, and related platform services
- AI and browser-rendering products

Best 11Writer uses if explicitly adopted:

- inspect and manage DNS or domain setup for public surfaces
- evaluate Cloudflare Access for companion-web protection
- automate edge-hosting or proxy infrastructure
- inspect or configure security, caching, or edge-delivery posture
- potentially support a future protected remote companion path

Possible 11Writer experiments:

- model a paired companion-web ingress protected by Cloudflare Access
- validate DNS and edge-routing setup for public docs or narrow public surfaces
- inspect current account capabilities and supported products before a hosting decision

Why this should be used carefully:

- this is an infrastructure mutation surface, not just read-only docs
- the connector is broad and can affect real account resources
- 11Writer currently requires conservative network posture: local-first, loopback-first, explicit pairing/auth before broader exposure

Guardrails:

- do not broaden network exposure or bind assumptions just because Cloudflare tooling exists
- use read-first exploration before any writes
- keep companion-web security and pairing/auth decisions repo-documented before infra changes
- do not treat edge infrastructure as a replacement for backend runtime truth

## Recommended Priority For 11Writer

Highest practical value now:

1. `Linear`
2. `Notion`
3. `Figma`
4. `LaTeX Tectonic`

Conditional or later-stage value:

5. `Cloudflare`
6. `Supabase`

Reasoning:

- the first four improve execution, design alignment, docs, and deliverables without forcing architecture changes
- the last two can be powerful, but they touch production architecture, hosting, data ownership, or security posture and should be treated as explicit project decisions

## Adoption Sequence

Use this order as the default unless the active task clearly points elsewhere.

### Use Now

1. `Linear`
2. `Notion`
3. `LaTeX Tectonic`

Why:

- high leverage
- low architecture risk
- directly improves execution, planning, and deliverables

### Use On Demand

4. `Figma`

Use it when:

- there is real design source material
- component mapping or design-to-code alignment is blocking work
- a frontend or macOS-native UI task actually benefits from it

### Prototype Later

5. `Cloudflare`
6. `Supabase`

Both are useful only when there is a specific architecture or runtime reason to test them in a bounded way.

## Avoid Unless Architecture Changes

Avoid these defaults unless the project deliberately changes direction:

- `Supabase` as core source-of-truth storage
- `Cloudflare` as a shortcut to public companion access before auth and pairing are settled
- `Notion` as a replacement for repo-owned technical truth
- `Figma` as a reason to redesign stable UI without a real product need

## Recommended First 30 Days

If the goal is immediate value with low risk:

1. Use `Linear` for one active implementation wave.
2. Use `Notion` for one bounded planning or review workspace.
3. Use `LaTeX Tectonic` for one formal PDF output.
4. Use `Figma` only when a real design handoff is active.

Do not start with:

- Supabase migration work
- Cloudflare write automation
- remote exposure changes

## Decision Tests

Adopt a connector now only if it passes these tests:

- does it improve execution without moving backend truth?
- does it preserve local-first and loopback-first assumptions?
- does it avoid creating a second authoritative runtime or planning system?
- can it be adopted in a bounded way and rolled back cheaply?

If the answer is no, treat it as prototype-later or avoid-unless-architecture-changes.

## Good Near-Term Uses

If the goal is immediate leverage with low risk, these are the best next moves:

- use `Linear` to structure current cross-platform and validation work
- use `Notion` for synthesized planning, source-review memory, and operating pages
- use `Figma` when frontend or macOS-native UI work needs design-to-code alignment
- use `LaTeX Tectonic` for formal PDF outputs from existing research, evidence, or roadmap material

## High-Caution Uses

Do not casually adopt these without explicit user direction and architecture review:

- `Supabase` as a replacement datastore for current backend truth
- `Cloudflare` as a shortcut to internet-facing companion access

Both can be valuable later, but both sit close to production architecture, security, and runtime-boundary decisions that 11Writer has already documented carefully.

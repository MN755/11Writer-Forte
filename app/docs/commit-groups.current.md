# Commit Groups Manifest

## Purpose

This file is a local consolidation artifact for the current mixed worktree on `main`. It groups currently modified and untracked files into proposed future commits so later staging can happen by task and by agent instead of by mixed diff.

Use this together with:

- `app/docs/active-agent-worktree.md`
- `app/docs/repo-workflow.md`
- `app/docs/validation-matrix.md`
- `app/docs/source-fusion-reporting-input-inventory.md`
- `app/docs/source-onboarding-contract.md`
- `app/docs/phase3-handoffs/connect-ai.md`

This file is planning only. Do not treat it as staging authorization.

## Current branch state

- Branch: `main`
- Worktree: mixed and dirty across multiple active agent lanes
- Before any Phase 3 shared-surface consolidation attempt, read `app/docs/phase3-handoffs/connect-ai.md` so live mixed-tree counts are not confused with the last green validation checkpoint.
- Latest Connect consolidation-readiness snapshot for assignment `2026-05-05 19:15 America/Chicago`:
  - the repo is still mixed but validation-green on the assigned shared reporting-loop surface
  - one current shared blocker reproduced and was fixed:
    - `app/server/src/services/source_discovery_service.py` had an indentation error that broke `compileall`
    - the fix was syntax-only and did not change runtime semantics
  - current live snapshot during the final validation rerun:
    - `modified=87`
    - `untracked=39`
    - `shared-high-collision: 5`
    - `unknown: 16`
  - `python scripts/release_dry_run.py --json` remains advisory-red because the repo is not clean and heuristic token-pattern checks still match `settings.py` plus `test_source_discovery_memory.py`
  - `python -m compileall app/server/src`, `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`, `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`, and `cmd /c npm.cmd run test:reporting-loop-package-contract` are green
  - `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json` currently reports `6` open low-priority alerts:
    - `Atlas AI: 6`
  - the shared reporting-loop compatibility surface now covers:
    - Aerospace fusion snapshot, report brief, current-awareness digest, VAAC advisory report package, and reporting handoff contract
    - Data AI fusion snapshot, report brief, current-awareness digest, topic-safe report export packet, and question briefing packet
    - Marine fusion snapshot, report brief, and current-awareness digest
  - ownership ambiguity removed in this pass:
    - `app/client/scripts/aerospaceReportingHandoffContractRegression.mjs` now sits under `aerospace`
    - `app/docs/environmental-question-briefing-packet.md` and `app/server/tests/test_environmental_question_briefing_packet.py` now sit under `geospatial-environmental`
    - `app/server/src/services/camera_source_ops_regional_portfolio_packet.py` now sits under `features-webcam`
  - remaining `unknown` files are still genuinely broad/shared:
    - `app/client/package.json`
    - `app/docs/phase2-next-after-next-shortlist.md`
    - `app/docs/phase2-next-biggest-wins-packet.md`

## Immediate manual-review set

- Top 5 files requiring manual consolidation review before any future staging:
  - `app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx`
  - `app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx`
  - `app/client/src/lib/queries.ts`
  - `app/server/src/config/settings.py`
  - `app/server/src/types/api.py`

## Shared-surface occupancy map

- Already occupied shared feature families:
  - aerospace:
    - evidence timeline package
    - workflow validation evidence snapshot
    - context review queue
    - context review export bundle
    - export coherence
    - issue export bundle
    - context snapshot report
    - source readiness and source readiness bundle
  - webcam/source ops:
    - candidate endpoint report
    - candidate network summary
    - review queue
    - review queue export bundle
    - source lifecycle summary
  - environmental:
    - source health issue queue package
    - weather observation review queue package
    - Canada context review queue package
  - shared runtime and analysis:
    - Data AI feed family review queue
    - Source Discovery review queue
    - Wave LLM review queue
    - analyst evidence timeline
    - analyst source readiness
- New work should extend or reconcile these surfaces before introducing parallel duplicate helpers with overlapping names.
- Shared reporting-loop package compatibility now also exists:
  - `app/docs/reporting-loop-package-contract.md`
  - `app/client/scripts/reportingLoopPackageContractRegression.mjs`
  - use these before adding another package-normalization helper in shared files

- Validation commands:
  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`
  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`
- Suggested commit message:
  - `Reconcile shared shell, panel, store, and type changes`
- Risk level:
  - high
- Notes for manual review:
  - this is not a blind catch-all commit
  - use patch staging to split hunks back into domain commits where practical
  - only leave truly shared reconciliations in this group

## Shared-file review guidance

### `app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx`

- Likely needed by:
  - geospatial-environmental-frontend
  - aerospace-workflows
  - marine-workflows
  - features-webcam-operations
  - shared reconciliation
- Why risky:
  - central shell state, export summary, and cross-panel behavior accumulate unrelated hunks fast
- Guidance:
  - do not auto-stage into any domain commit
  - review diff hunks manually
  - prefer `git add -p` if staging partial ownership

### `app/client/src/features/layers/LayerPanel.tsx`

- Likely needed by:
  - geospatial-environmental-frontend
  - features-webcam-operations
  - shared reconciliation
- Why risky:
  - multiple layer families converge here and UI sections are easy to interleave
- Guidance:
  - do not auto-stage into a single domain commit without hunk review

### `app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx`

- Likely needed by:
  - geospatial-environmental-frontend
  - aerospace-workflows
  - marine-workflows
  - shared reconciliation
- Why risky:
  - inspector surfaces cross-domain entity detail and evidence blocks
- Guidance:
  - hunk-split by entity type if possible
  - if not possible, hold for explicit reconciliation

### `app/client/src/lib/store.ts`

- Likely needed by:
  - geospatial-environmental-frontend
  - aerospace-workflows
  - marine-workflows
  - features-webcam-operations
  - shared reconciliation
- Why risky:
  - global state keys and selectors are shared by all lanes
- Guidance:
  - do not auto-stage
  - stage by reviewed hunk only

### `app/client/src/lib/queries.ts`

- Likely needed by:
  - geospatial-environmental-frontend
  - shared reconciliation
- Why risky:
  - query hooks are a shared contract surface
- Guidance:
  - verify each query maps to the correct backend group before staging

### `app/client/src/styles/global.css`

- Likely needed by:
  - multiple frontend lanes
  - shared reconciliation
- Why risky:
  - unrelated style changes co-mingle easily
- Guidance:
  - avoid broad staging
  - split by hunk if possible

### `app/client/src/types/api.ts` and `app/client/src/types/entities.ts`

- Likely needed by:
  - geospatial-environmental-frontend
  - aerospace-workflows
  - marine-workflows
  - features-webcam-operations
  - shared reconciliation
- Why risky:
  - shared types can silently mix domain-specific additions
- Guidance:
  - match each type hunk back to its owning backend or feature group before staging

### `app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs`

- Likely needed by:
  - shared-smoke-fixture-harness
  - domain groups only indirectly
- Why risky:
  - contains assertions for multiple lanes in one file
- Guidance:
  - do not auto-stage into a domain commit
  - split by scenario hunk only if the ownership is obvious

### `app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py` and `app/server/tests/smoke_fixture_app.py`

- Likely needed by:
  - shared-smoke-fixture-harness
  - Connect/tooling
  - domain smoke support
- Why risky:
  - these files mix environment handling, shared fixtures, and scenario support
- Guidance:
  - separate Connect/tooling preflight hunks from feature-support hunks where practical
  - otherwise hold for explicit manual review

## Suggested consolidation command patterns

Examples only. Do not run blindly.

### Inspect current state

```bash
git status --short
git diff --stat
```

### Stage a clean task group

```bash
git add app/docs/repo-workflow.md app/docs/active-agent-worktree.md app/docs/commit-groups.current.md
git diff --cached --stat
git commit -m "Document multi-agent commit consolidation workflow"
```

### Stage a domain group with explicit files

```bash
git add app/server/src/routes/events.py app/server/src/services/eonet_service.py app/server/tests/test_eonet_events.py app/server/data/nasa_eonet_events_fixture.json
git diff --cached --stat
git commit -m "Add environmental event backend sources and contracts"
```

### Stage a shared file by hunk

```bash
git add -p app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx
git add -p app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx
git add -p app/client/src/lib/store.ts
git diff --cached --stat
```

### Re-check remaining worktree

```bash
git status --short
```

## Recommended later consolidation approach

1. Land Connect docs-only work first because it is low risk and reduces future staging confusion.
2. Land Gather registry docs and JSON as one clean, independent commit.
3. Split geospatial backend from geospatial frontend so backend services and tests do not get blocked on shared UI files.
4. Land the domain-specific non-shared aerospace, marine, and webcam files before attempting cross-lane shell reconciliation.
5. Treat smoke harness files as their own review pass unless a clear Connect-only subset can be isolated.
6. Use patch staging on shared shell, panel, store, query, and type files.
7. Leave any ambiguous shared hunks for a final explicit reconciliation commit instead of guessing.

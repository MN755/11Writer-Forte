# Marine Context Source Contract Matrix

Marine subsystem only. This matrix records the backend contract expectations for currently implemented marine context sources.

Interpretation rules:
- These sources provide marine review context only.
- They do not change marine anomaly scoring.
- They must not be presented as proof of vessel behavior, intent, pollution impact, or health risk.

## Required Backend Contract Guarantees

- Fixture/local mode must be explicit for all eight sources when running in fixture mode.
- Disabled/non-fixture mode must return a disabled health state rather than fabricating live behavior.
- Empty nearby results must return `health=empty`, not `error`.
- Source-level caveats must remain present for all eight sources.
- Event/observation-level caveats must remain present where fixture records include them.
- CO-OPS and NDBC observations must keep `observed` evidence basis semantics.
- GEBCO bounded bathymetry samples must keep `contextual` evidence basis semantics.
- Ireland OPW, Vigicrues, and Netherlands RWS Waterinfo hydrology observations must keep `observed` evidence basis semantics.
- Scottish Water overflow events must keep `source-reported` / contextual infrastructure semantics.
- NAVTEX broadcast notices must keep `advisory` warning-context semantics.

## Current Source-Health State Boundary

The source-health models allow broader states such as `stale`, `error`, and `unknown`, but the current deterministic marine context services do not honestly synthesize those states in fixture mode.

Current backend truth:
- fixture mode can emit:
  - `loaded`
  - `empty`
  - `stale`
- non-fixture / unimplemented mode emits:
  - `disabled`
- `degraded` is currently emitted only for:
  - Scottish Water Overflows
  - USCG NAVTEX Broadcast Notices
  - France Vigicrues Hydrometry
  - Ireland OPW Water Level
  - Netherlands RWS Waterinfo
- `unavailable` is currently emitted for all eight sources when source retrieval fails

This is intentional in the current slice:
- stale is based on returned observation/update timestamps, not fetch-time theater
- unavailable is based on actual source retrieval failure within the backend service path
- degraded is only emitted where returned records carry real partial-metadata evidence at the source-health layer
- CO-OPS and NDBC still do not emit `degraded` because their current fixture slices do not have an honest partial-ingest/source-quality degradation signal

## Downstream Export / Reporting Consumers

- `marineAnomalySummary.sourceHealthExportCoherence` remains the source-row timestamp/mode/health export substrate for marine-local reporting packages.
- `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologySourceHealthReport` preserves the hydrology/ocean-met review posture, including explicit Vigicrues status carry-through.
- `marineAnomalySummary.corridorReviewPackage` preserves corridor/chokepoint review posture and bounded replay/context counts.
- `marineAnomalySummary.fusionSnapshotInput` composes those existing surfaces into one export-only reporting input without merging source families into anomaly severity or intent evidence.
- `marineAnomalySummary.reportBriefPackage` converts the fusion snapshot input into stable `observe / orient / prioritize / explain` report sections while keeping Vigicrues and Waterinfo workflow-evidence wording bounded to source-health/export-path confirmation only.
- `marineAnomalySummary.corridorSituationPackage` converts the current reporting stack into a corridor-focused situation artifact while keeping corridor/chokepoint, hydrology, ocean/met, and infrastructure context bounded to source-health-aware review/reporting evidence only.
- `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologyRegionalComparisonPackage` converts the current hydrology/reporting stack into a bounded regional comparison artifact while keeping Vigicrues, Waterinfo, OPW, and related hydrology context bounded to source-health/workflow-evidence comparison only.
- `marineAnomalySummary.currentAwarenessDigest` converts the existing marine reporting stack into one bounded open-ended digest while keeping corridor/chokepoint, hydrology, source-health, and workflow-evidence posture bounded to review/reporting context only.
- `marineAnomalySummary.sourceRowWorkflowClosurePacket` converts the existing marine reporting stack into one bounded source-row/export-coherence packet while keeping source rows, corridor/chokepoint posture, hydrology posture, and workflow-evidence posture bounded to review/reporting context only.
- `marineAnomalySummary.questionBriefingPacket` converts the existing marine reporting stack into one bounded question-driven briefing packet while keeping question posture, source rows, corridor/chokepoint posture, hydrology posture, workflow-evidence posture, and export-coherence posture bounded to review/reporting context only.

## Validation Boundary

Backend contract coverage can be validated independently with:

```bash
python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_marine_contracts.py -q
python -m compileall app/server/src
```

Frontend smoke/build confirmation remains a separate layer and may depend on Connect AI clearing repo-wide frontend blockers.

Current deterministic marine smoke fixture posture:
- `Scottish Water Overflows` is surfaced as a degraded workflow example so marine export/source-summary paths visibly preserve partial-metadata limitations
- `France Vigicrues Hydrometry` is surfaced as an unavailable workflow example so marine export/source-summary paths visibly preserve missing-context semantics
- `Ireland OPW Water Level` is surfaced as an additional degraded workflow example so review/report helpers see a source mix where degraded/unavailable context dominates loaded context
- `USCG NAVTEX Broadcast Notices` is surfaced through marine-local card, source-summary, fusion, and export metadata assertions as advisory warning context only
- `GEBCO Gridded Bathymetry` is surfaced through a dedicated marine-local card and export metadata assertions as static seafloor context only
- these smoke examples do not change the backend contract truth for the source families; they only ensure degraded/unavailable states stay visible in marine-owned workflow surfaces
- Netherlands RWS Waterinfo, NAVTEX, and GEBCO all now have marine-local cards plus dedicated export metadata assertions in the current smoke slice

## Downstream Fusion / Review Consumers

These frontend-local marine helpers do not define new backend routes, but they depend on the source contracts above remaining stable:

- `app/client/src/features/marine/marineContextFusionSummary.ts`
  - consumes combined environmental context, hydrology context, Scottish Water context, source-summary rows, and issue-queue output
  - exports `marineAnomalySummary.contextFusionSummary`
- `app/client/src/features/marine/marineContextReviewReport.ts`
  - consumes context-fusion summary plus issue-queue output
  - exports `marineAnomalySummary.contextReviewReport`
  - when degraded/unavailable source-health dominates the current source mix, review phrasing must remain `partial context` / `review caveat` only and must not imply event severity, impact, anomaly cause, vessel behavior, or wrongdoing
- `app/client/src/features/marine/marineContextIssueExportBundle.ts`
  - consumes source-summary rows plus issue-queue output
  - exports `marineAnomalySummary.contextIssueExportBundle`
  - must preserve source family distinctions, allowed review actions, and `does not prove` guardrails without turning source-health limitations into severity or impact language
- `app/client/src/features/marine/marineSourceHealthExportCoherence.ts`
  - consumes CO-OPS, NDBC, Vigicrues, Ireland OPW, and Netherlands RWS Waterinfo summary metadata
  - exports `marineAnomalySummary.sourceHealthExportCoherence`
  - must stay bounded to current export-safe metadata such as source mode, source health, evidence basis, nearby counts, latest timestamp posture, and caveats
- `app/client/src/features/marine/marineHydrologySourceHealthWorkflow.ts`
  - consumes `marineSourceHealthExportCoherence` output
  - exports `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologySourceHealthWorkflow`
  - must keep hydrology rows distinct from CO-OPS/NDBC comparison rows and must not imply flood impact, anomaly cause, navigation safety, vessel behavior, or vessel intent
- `app/client/src/features/marine/marineHydrologySourceHealthReport.ts`
  - consumes `marineHydrologySourceHealthWorkflow` output
  - exports `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologySourceHealthReport`
  - must preserve source mode, source health, evidence basis, latest timestamp posture, station/observation counts, family grouping, and explicit Vigicrues row/status-line coherence without adding behavioral, impact, or severity claims
- `app/client/src/features/marine/marineCorridorReviewPackage.ts`
  - consumes `marineChokepointReviewPackage`, source-summary rows, environmental context, hydrology context, and hydrology/source-health report output
  - exports `marineAnomalySummary.corridorReviewPackage`
  - must preserve corridor label, bounded-area label, replay/gap review counts, source ids/modes/health/evidence basis/caveats, explicit Vigicrues row/status-line coherence, and review-only export lines without adding geopolitical, behavioral, impact, or action-need claims

Contract implication:
- if any source above loses required source health, source mode, caveat, or evidence-basis semantics, the fusion/review package becomes less trustworthy even if the frontend still renders
- if any source above loses category, evidence-basis, or caveat truth, the issue export bundle becomes less trustworthy even if the frontend still renders
- shared frontend smoke should re-confirm these downstream helpers only after Connect AI clears repo-wide build blockers

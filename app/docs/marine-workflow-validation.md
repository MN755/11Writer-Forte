# Marine Workflow Validation

This document records the workflow-validation bundle for the marine subsystem context sources and context workflows.

Purpose:

- separate `implemented` from `workflow-validated`
- keep marine context workflow evidence easy to audit
- make smoke and export expectations explicit

- [marine-context-fixture-reference.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/marine-context-fixture-reference.md)

## Validation Checklist

### Baseline

- backend contract tests pass:
  - `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_marine_contracts.py -q`
  - `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_marine_navtex.py -q`
  - `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_marine_gebco.py -q`
  - `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_vigicrues_hydrometry.py -q`
  - `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_ireland_opw_waterlevel.py -q`
  - `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_netherlands_rws_waterinfo.py -q`
- backend imports/typing pass:
  - `python -m compileall app/server/src`
- frontend build passes:
  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`
- frontend lint passes when no unrelated repo-wide blockers remain:
  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`
- marine smoke passes:
  - `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py marine`

### Backend Contract Coverage

- marine backend contract tests explicitly cover:
  - NOAA CO-OPS
  - NOAA NDBC
  - Scottish Water Overflows
  - USCG NAVTEX Broadcast Notices
  - GEBCO Gridded Bathymetry
  - France Vigicrues Hydrometry
  - Ireland OPW Water Level
  - Netherlands RWS Waterinfo
- required source fields remain present:
  - source id / label
  - source mode
  - source health
  - loaded count
  - caveat
- required empty behavior remains:
  - nearby no-match returns `health=empty`
  - empty is not treated as backend error
- required evidence-basis semantics remain:
  - CO-OPS latest observations stay `observed`
  - NDBC latest observations stay `observed`
  - Scottish Water overflow status stays `source-reported` / contextual
  - NAVTEX broadcast notices stay `advisory`
  - GEBCO bounded bathymetry samples stay `contextual`
  - Vigicrues latest hydrometry observations stay `observed`
  - Ireland OPW latest water-level readings stay `observed`
  - Netherlands RWS Waterinfo latest water-level observations stay `observed`
- disabled-mode behavior remains explicit for non-fixture mode in this phase:
  - health `disabled`
  - live mode not fabricated
- source-health boundary remains explicit in this phase:
  - fixture mode can now emit `stale` when returned observation/update timestamps honestly exceed source freshness thresholds
  - fixture mode can now emit `unavailable` when source retrieval fails inside the backend service path
  - current services validate `loaded`, `empty`, `stale`, `disabled`, and `unavailable`
  - current services validate `degraded` for:
    - Scottish Water Overflows
    - USCG NAVTEX Broadcast Notices
    - France Vigicrues Hydrometry
    - Ireland OPW Water Level
    - Netherlands RWS Waterinfo
  - CO-OPS, NDBC, and GEBCO still do not emit `degraded` because the current slices have no honest partial-ingest/source-quality degradation signal
  - CO-OPS, NDBC, Scottish Water, NAVTEX, GEBCO, Vigicrues, Ireland OPW, and Netherlands RWS Waterinfo all have dedicated regression coverage for these boundaries
- route validation should reject invalid coordinates/radius values with request validation errors

### Context Fusion / Review Contract Dependencies

These marine-local helpers do not define new backend routes. Their workflow validation depends on already-tested marine context-source contracts plus marine export metadata wiring.

  - report title / summary line
  - `marineAnomalySummary.contextReviewReport` metadata block
  - explicit `does not prove` language remains present
  - degraded/unavailable-dominant smoke posture yields `partial context` / `review caveat` wording and preserves wrongdoing guardrails

### Fusion / Review Validation Evidence

| Workflow | Backend / metadata dependencies | Visible card / helper | Deterministic smoke evidence | Export metadata key | Caveat boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Marine Context Fusion Summary | `environmentalContext`, `hydrologyContext`, `scottishWaterOverflowContext`, `contextSourceSummary`, `contextIssueQueue` | `Marine Context Fusion` via `marineContextFusionSummary.ts` | card text includes `Ocean/met context`, `Hydrology context`, `Infrastructure context`, `Export readiness`, and degraded/unavailable-dominant `partial context` wording; snapshot metadata requires family count, family lines, export readiness, priority caveats, and dominant-limitation wording when applicable | `marineAnomalySummary.contextFusionSummary` | no cross-family severity score; no anomaly-cause, flood-impact, contamination, health-impact, damage, vessel-behavior, or vessel-intent inference |

### Helper-Level Regression Coverage

- helper-level deterministic regression coverage now exists outside Playwright smoke:
  - `app/client/scripts/marineContextHelperRegression.mjs`
- run with:
  - from `app/client`:
    - `cmd /c npm.cmd run test:marine-context-helpers`
- this coverage guards:
  - anchor/radius/fallback transition coherence across:
    - selected-vessel anchored context
    - viewport/manual fallback context
    - chokepoint bounded-area context
    - radius-change context for the same selected entity/source set
  - source-toggle and preset-switch transition coherence across:
    - broad/all-sources review context
    - limited/degraded review context with disabled-source rows
  - focused evidence interpretation mode-switch coherence across:
    - `compact`
    - `detailed`
    - `evidence-only`
    - `caveats-first`
  - visible interpretation-card kind / label / basis export coherence for every mode
  - degraded/unavailable-dominant fusion wording
  - review-report `partial context` / `review caveat` wording
  - chokepoint-review export wording for bounded corridor label, crossing-count support, source-health gaps, and focused review signals
  - context-timeline/chokepoint coherence for current and previous review-lens snapshots
  - context-timeline preset/source-toggle transition coherence for current and previous review-lens snapshots
  - context-timeline anchor/radius/fallback coherence for current and previous review-lens snapshots
  - alignment between environmental anchor/effective-anchor metadata, fallback reason, radius, bounded-area label, source-summary rows, issue visibility, issue-export review actions, fusion family detail, review-report caveats, and focused interpretation environmental caveats
  - alignment between enabled/disabled source rows, issue-queue visibility, issue-export review actions, fusion limited-source counts, environmental preset metadata, and focused interpretation source-mode caveats
  - alignment between focused interpretation mode metadata, chokepoint review package, context timeline, issue export bundle, and top-level marine caveats
  - `does not prove` guardrails for impact, anomaly cause, vessel behavior, vessel intent, and wrongdoing
  - chokepoint-specific no-inference guardrails for AIS/signal gaps, reroutes, queue/backlog wording, evasion, escort, toll activity, blockade, targeting, threat, and causation
  - source-family distinctions in the issue export bundle
  - full `marineAnomalySummary` export-package coherence across:
    - `focusedEvidenceInterpretation`
    - `contextFusionSummary`
    - `contextReviewReport`
    - `contextSourceSummary`
    - `contextIssueQueue`
    - `contextIssueExportBundle`
    - `hydrologyContext`
    - `sourceHealthExportCoherence`
    - `chokepointReviewPackage`
    - `contextTimeline`
    - `hydrologySourceHealthWorkflow`
    - `hydrologySourceHealthReport`

    - `fusionSnapshotInput`
    - `reportBriefPackage`
    - `corridorSituationPackage`
    - `hydrologyRegionalComparisonPackage`
  - hydrology/source-health report posture coverage for:
    - broad source posture
    - limited source posture
    - empty/stale source posture
    - missing-source posture
  - explicit Vigicrues export coherence across:
    - hydrology/source-health report rows
    - hydrology/source-health report status line
    - corridor review package rows
    - corridor review package status line
    - fusion snapshot input hydrology posture
    - report-brief workflow-evidence lines
    - corridor-situation workflow-evidence lines
    - hydrology comparison workflow-evidence lines
    - current-awareness digest workflow-evidence lines
  - corridor/chokepoint review posture coverage for:
    - normal posture
    - degraded posture
    - empty/no-match posture
    - missing-source posture
  - current-awareness digest coverage for:
    - bounded `observe / orient / prioritize / explain` sections
    - corridor/chokepoint carry-through
    - hydrology comparison carry-through
    - source-health/workflow-evidence carry-through
    - explicit no-impact/no-closure/no-action/no-wrongdoing guardrails
  - source-row workflow/export closure packet coverage for:
    - source-row carry-through
    - export-coherence posture carry-through
    - corridor/chokepoint carry-through
    - hydrology posture carry-through
    - workflow-evidence carry-through
    - explicit no-impact/no-closure/no-action/no-wrongdoing guardrails
  - question briefing packet coverage for:
    - question-family posture carry-through
    - source-row/source-health posture carry-through
    - corridor/chokepoint and hydrology posture carry-through
    - workflow-evidence/export-coherence carry-through
    - explicit no-impact/no-closure/no-wrongdoing/no-action guardrails
- source-health/export coherence across CO-OPS, NDBC, Vigicrues, Ireland OPW, and Netherlands RWS Waterinfo uses only current exported metadata:
  - source mode
  - source health
  - evidence basis
  - nearby station counts
  - exported-observation counts
  - latest timestamp posture
  - caveats
- this keeps no-severity/no-impact/no-intent phrasing from depending only on browser smoke

### Context Source Visibility

- source health/source mode is visible for:
  - NOAA CO-OPS
  - NOAA NDBC
  - Scottish Water Overflows
  - GEBCO Gridded Bathymetry
  - France Vigicrues Hydrometry
  - Ireland OPW Water Level
- fixture/local mode remains explicit where applicable
- degraded/unavailable source-health states are now workflow-visible in the deterministic marine smoke path
- the deterministic smoke posture now also verifies that degraded/unavailable-heavy context mixes are described as partial context and source-health limitation, not event severity
- nearby counts are visible
- active counts are visible where applicable

### Marine Context Workflow Coverage

- combined marine environmental context renders
- marine context source registry renders all context sources
- marine context issue queue renders source-health issues without implying vessel behavior
- GEBCO gridded bathymetry renders as a separate static-context card and export block rather than being merged into warning or hydrology family summaries
- marine hydrology context review summary renders Vigicrues, Ireland OPW, and Netherlands RWS Waterinfo together without creating a merged severity signal
- marine context fusion summary renders ocean/met, hydrology, and infrastructure families without collapsing them into one severity model
- marine context review report renders degraded/unavailable-dominant phrasing as a review caveat rather than impact or anomaly language
- marine context review report renders review-needed items, caveat lines, and does-not-prove lines from the existing fusion/issue path
- marine context issue export bundle preserves source family, health state, source mode, evidence basis, allowed review action, and does-not-prove lines across marine context sources
- marine chokepoint review package preserves bounded corridor label, time window, crossing-count support, source-health limitations, focused replay/context signals, and explicit no-evasion/no-threat/no-causation wording
- marine context timeline preserves chokepoint review-lens coherence for corridor label, focused target, focused evidence kinds, context-gap count, and source-health caveat wording across current and previous snapshots
- marine context timeline also preserves preset/source-toggle transition coherence across current and previous snapshots, including enabled sources and active preset label
- marine context timeline also preserves anchor/radius/fallback transition coherence across current and previous snapshots, including:
  - selected-vessel vs fallback-viewport effective anchor
  - chokepoint bounded-area label
  - current/previous radius values
- environmental presets update controls
- environmental source toggles update the visible context path
- deterministic helper regression now verifies that preset/toggle transitions keep:
  - disabled rows in `contextSourceSummary`
  - disabled-source visibility in `contextIssueQueue`
  - disabled-source review actions in `contextIssueExportBundle`
  - limited-source counts in `contextFusionSummary`
  - active preset/source-toggle state in `environmentalContext`, `contextTimeline`, and `focusedEvidenceInterpretation`
- deterministic helper regression now also verifies that anchor/radius/fallback transitions keep:
  - active anchor/effective-anchor metadata in `environmentalContext`
  - fallback-center reason in export metadata and environmental caveats
  - bounded-area label coherence between `chokepointReviewPackage` and `contextTimeline`
  - radius changes in current/previous timeline snapshots without changing anomaly scores, source ids, source health, or evidence bases
- context timeline records context-lens changes
- context timeline clear action works

### Export Metadata Coverage

Marine export metadata should include:

- `marineAnomalySummary.noaaCoopsContext`
- `marineAnomalySummary.ndbcContext`
- `marineAnomalySummary.scottishWaterOverflowContext`
- `marineAnomalySummary.navtexContext`
- `marineAnomalySummary.gebcoBathymetryContext`
- `marineAnomalySummary.vigicruesHydrometryContext`
- `marineAnomalySummary.irelandOpwWaterLevelContext`
- `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologyContext`
- `marineAnomalySummary.sourceHealthExportCoherence`
- `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologySourceHealthWorkflow`
- `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologySourceHealthReport`
- `marineAnomalySummary.corridorReviewPackage`
- `marineAnomalySummary.contextFusionSummary`
- `marineAnomalySummary.contextReviewReport`
- `marineAnomalySummary.environmentalContext`
- `marineAnomalySummary.contextSourceSummary`
- `marineAnomalySummary.contextIssueQueue`
- `marineAnomalySummary.contextIssueExportBundle`
- `marineAnomalySummary.contextTimeline`
- `marineAnomalySummary.chokepointReviewPackage`
- `marineAnomalySummary.focusedEvidenceInterpretation`

### Caveat / Semantics Checks

- no vessel-intent inference wording
- no pollution-impact or health-risk claim wording for Scottish Water
- no route-safety, closure-truth, grounding-risk, or incident-truth wording for GEBCO
- no flood-impact or damage claim wording for Vigicrues hydrometry
- environmental context remains separate from anomaly evidence
- Scottish Water remains separate from combined CO-OPS/NDBC environmental context
- CO-OPS/NDBC/Scottish Water/NAVTEX/GEBCO/Vigicrues source-level caveats remain present in backend responses
- forbidden claims remain:
  - intentional AIS disablement
  - vessel wrongdoing or route-choice causation from context sources
  - confirmed pollution impact / health risk from Scottish Water status alone
  - confirmed flood impact, inundation, or damage from Vigicrues station values alone

## Notes

- This checklist records workflow evidence only.
- It does not promote any source beyond marine-owned workflow validation.
- Context workflows support review and export clarity only; they do not imply vessel behavior, anomaly cause, or intent.
- Context-source issues classify availability/health limitations only; they are not anomaly or intent signals.
- Repo-wide frontend build/smoke remains a separate confirmation layer; after Connect AI clears shared blockers, marine smoke should continue confirming cards, export metadata, presets, issue queue, and timeline against the same backend contract guarantees.
- The marine-only smoke path now explicitly confirms the Vigicrues hydrometry card, the Vigicrues row in the marine context source summary, and the `marineAnomalySummary.vigicruesHydrometryContext` export metadata block.
- The marine-only smoke path now explicitly confirms the Ireland OPW water-level card, the Ireland OPW row in the marine context source summary, and the `marineAnomalySummary.irelandOpwWaterLevelContext` export metadata block.
- The marine-only smoke path now explicitly confirms the Netherlands RWS Waterinfo card, the Waterinfo row in the marine context source summary, and the `marineAnomalySummary.netherlandsRwsWaterinfoContext` export metadata block.
- The marine-only smoke path now explicitly confirms the USCG NAVTEX Broadcast Notices card, the NAVTEX row in the marine context source summary, and the `marineAnomalySummary.navtexContext` export metadata block.
- The marine-only smoke path now explicitly confirms the GEBCO Gridded Bathymetry card and the `marineAnomalySummary.gebcoBathymetryContext` export metadata block.
- The marine-only smoke path now explicitly confirms the composed marine hydrology context card and the `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologyContext` export metadata block.
- Marine source-health export coherence has no dedicated UI card, but the marine-only smoke path now confirms its snapshot metadata block.
- The marine-only smoke path now also confirms snapshot metadata for:
  - `marineAnomalySummary.sourceHealthExportCoherence`
  - `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologySourceHealthWorkflow`
  - `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologySourceHealthReport`
  - `marineAnomalySummary.corridorReviewPackage`
  - `marineAnomalySummary.fusionSnapshotInput`
  - explicit Vigicrues rows/status lines inside the hydrology and corridor review packages
- `marineAnomalySummary.fusionSnapshotInput` is export-only and has no dedicated UI card; smoke/regression confirm its metadata block, source rows, Vigicrues posture carry-through, and does-not-prove guardrails.
- `marineAnomalySummary.reportBriefPackage` is export-only and has no dedicated UI card; smoke/regression confirm its `observe / orient / prioritize / explain` sections plus explicit Vigicrues and Waterinfo workflow-evidence wording.
- `marineAnomalySummary.corridorSituationPackage` is export-only and has no dedicated UI card; smoke/regression confirm its corridor posture, `observe / orient / prioritize / explain` sections, Vigicrues/Waterinfo workflow-evidence wording, and explicit no-closure/no-intent/no-action guardrails.
- `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologyRegionalComparisonPackage` is export-only and has no dedicated UI card; smoke/regression confirm hydrology rows, Vigicrues/Waterinfo/OPW workflow-evidence wording, freshness posture, and explicit no-impact/no-closure/no-action guardrails.
- The marine-only smoke path now explicitly confirms the composed marine context fusion card and the `marineAnomalySummary.contextFusionSummary` export metadata block.
- The marine-only smoke path now explicitly confirms the composed marine context review report card and the `marineAnomalySummary.contextReviewReport` export metadata block.
- The marine-only smoke path now explicitly surfaces:
  - one degraded source-health example via Scottish Water Overflows
  - one unavailable source-health example via France Vigicrues Hydrometry
  - corresponding `contextSourceSummary` counts/rows and `contextIssueQueue` warnings in export metadata
- A remaining semantics gap stays documented rather than "fixed": `degraded` is still not emitted for CO-OPS, NDBC, or GEBCO because the current slices have no honest partial-ingest/source-quality degradation signal to surface at the source-health layer.

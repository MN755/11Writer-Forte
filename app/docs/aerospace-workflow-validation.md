# Aerospace Workflow Validation

This checklist is scoped to the aerospace / aircraft-satellite subsystem only.
It covers validation of contextual source slices, selected-target metadata, export shaping, and evidence caveats.
It does not validate marine, webcam, reference-subsystem internals, or broader geospatial event workflows.

Read [aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md) alongside this checklist.
That ledger is the aerospace-specific source of truth for distinguishing:
implemented helper surfaces,
machine metadata preservation,
backend contract evidence,
client lint/build evidence,
prepared smoke assertions,
and executed smoke evidence.

## Current Validation Posture

- Assignment-wave truth:
  the `aerospaceWorkflowValidationEvidenceSnapshot` helper and its metadata/export wiring were completed before the current `2026-05-04 21:43 America/Chicago` wave, but the older progress log recorded that work under the stale assignment marker `2026-05-02 15:47 America/Chicago`.
  Aerospace progress truth now acknowledges that stale-marker mismatch explicitly.
- Current local validation truth must be recorded exactly as observed:
  backend contract tests passed,
  frontend build passed,
  frontend lint passed on the current rerun, so the previously reported Marine-owned drift is not the active blocker now,
  and Playwright aerospace smoke is still not executed workflow evidence on this Windows host when Chromium fails to launch with `spawn EPERM` before app assertions begin.
- Guardrail:
  do not collapse prepared smoke assertions, successful build output, or implemented helper presence into executed browser workflow evidence.

## Validation Goals

- Confirm selected-target aerospace context appears without replacing the primary aircraft/satellite workflow.
- Confirm export metadata preserves contextual source summaries and caveats.
- Confirm operational-context composition and availability accounting are present.

- Confirm aerospace evidence-timeline/export package accounting is present without collapsing timeline order into causation, and without implying intent, impact, failure, airport/runway availability, route consequence, safety conclusion, or action recommendation.
- Confirm aerospace fusion-snapshot input accounting is present as a stable future cross-domain domain input over the existing aerospace package stack, without replacing those surfaces or collapsing distinct evidence classes together.
- Confirm aerospace report-brief package accounting is present as a report-ready transformation over fusion input that keeps observe/orient/prioritize/explain sections bounded and does not duplicate existing aerospace review/export/timeline helpers.
- Confirm aerospace selected-target operational question packet accounting is present as a bounded answer to what context exists for the selected target right now while keeping source classes distinct and non-causal.
- Confirm aerospace space-weather continuity package accounting is present as a bounded continuity layer over current SWPC advisories, archival NCEI metadata, and observed USGS geomagnetism while keeping those source classes distinct.
- Confirm aerospace VAAC advisory report-package accounting is present as a bounded advisory/source-reported transformation over the implemented VAAC context, without implying route impact, ash-plume precision beyond the source, aircraft exposure, or operational conclusions.
- Confirm aerospace package-coherence accounting is present as a non-duplicative parity surface over the existing helper stack, without implying severity, source certification, behavior proof, operational consequence, or action recommendation.
- Confirm optional geomagnetism context remains contextual-only and export-aware.
- Confirm bounded VAAC advisory context remains contextual-only, provenance-preserving, and export-aware.
- Confirm NOAA NCEI archive metadata remains archival/contextual, export-aware, and explicitly separate from NOAA SWPC current advisories.
- Confirm OpenSky anonymous comparison remains optional, guarded, and non-authoritative.
- Confirm no source slice introduces flight-intent, failure, impact, or causation claims.

## Smoke Coverage Notes

When the aerospace Playwright environment is healthy, smoke should validate metadata presence for:

- AWC metadata
- FAA NAS metadata
- CNEOS metadata
- SWPC metadata
- geomagnetism metadata
- OpenSky metadata
- OpenSky selected-target comparison
- aerospace operational context
- aerospace context availability
- aerospace current-vs-archive space-weather context
- aerospace context issues
- aerospace export readiness
- aerospace source readiness
- aerospace context review queue
- aerospace context review export bundle
- aerospace export coherence
- aerospace issue export bundle
- aerospace context snapshot/report package
- aerospace workflow readiness package
- aerospace workflow validation evidence snapshot
- aerospace fusion snapshot input
- aerospace report brief package
- aerospace selected-target operational question packet
- aerospace space-weather continuity package
- aerospace VAAC advisory report package
- aerospace context report
- aerospace review queue
- aerospace export profile

These checks should stay metadata/text-based.
Do not expand them into Cesium canvas-picking requirements.

If Playwright launch or browser environment is unstable, document the deferral and rely on:

- backend contract tests
- server compile
- frontend lint
- frontend build when available

Current local blocker after the 2026-04-30 aerospace smoke attempt:

- the deterministic aerospace smoke harness did not reach browser assertions on this Windows host because Playwright Chromium launch failed up front with `spawn EPERM`
- the runner already classifies that failure as `windows-playwright-launch-permission`, which is a machine-environment issue rather than an aerospace contract or assertion failure

Workflow evidence that still waits on successful smoke execution:

- end-to-end confirmation that the current built frontend preserves all aerospace metadata fields in the snapshot/export path in an executed aerospace smoke run on a host where Playwright can launch
- execution of the already-prepared metadata-level aerospace smoke assertions for:
  `aviationWeatherContext`,
  `faaNasAirportStatus`,
  `cneosSpaceContext`,
  `swpcSpaceWeatherContext`,
  `geomagnetismContext`,
  `openskyAnonymousContext`,
  `openskyAnonymousContext.selectedTargetComparison`,

## Evidence and Semantics Guardrails

- AWC remains contextual airport weather, not airborne truth at exact target position.
- FAA NAS remains contextual/advisory airport status, not flight-specific behavior.
- CNEOS remains contextual space-event evidence, not impact prediction.
- SWPC remains advisory/contextual space-weather evidence, not proof of real satellite/GPS/radio failure.
- Geomagnetism remains observatory magnetic-field context only, not target-specific avionics or space-system truth.
- OpenSky anonymous remains optional, rate-limited, current-state-vector context only.
- Washington VAAC remains advisory/contextual volcanic-ash source text only, not route-impact, aircraft-exposure, engine-risk, threat, or operational-consequence truth.
- Anchorage VAAC remains advisory/contextual volcanic-ash source text only, not route-impact, aircraft-exposure, engine-risk, threat, or operational-consequence truth.
- Tokyo VAAC remains advisory/contextual volcanic-ash source text only, not route-impact, aircraft-exposure, engine-risk, threat, or operational-consequence truth.
- Aerospace context-review notes remain trust/coverage summaries only.
- Aerospace context-review queue notes remain review/accounting summaries only; they are not severity, route-impact, target-behavior, or action-guidance statements.
- Aerospace context-review export-bundle notes remain export-safe review/accounting lines only; they are not severity, route-impact, target-behavior, or action-guidance statements.
- Aerospace current-vs-archive space-weather separation notes remain source-separation and timestamp/coverage accounting only.
- Aerospace export-coherence notes remain metadata-alignment checks only; they are not source certification or operational interpretation.
- Aerospace issue-export-bundle notes remain review-only export-accounting items; they are not severity scoring, operational consequence statements, failure proof, route-impact claims, target-exposure claims, threat calls, causation claims, or action guidance.
- Aerospace context snapshot/report package notes remain compact report-facing metadata only; they are not source certification, severity scoring, operational consequence statements, failure proof, route-impact claims, target-exposure claims, threat calls, causation claims, or action guidance.
- Aerospace workflow-readiness package notes remain workflow-evidence accounting only; they are not source certification, severity scoring, airport/runway availability truth, failure proof, route-impact claims, target-exposure claims, threat calls, causation claims, or action guidance.
- Aerospace workflow-validation evidence snapshot notes remain validation-accounting only; they do not convert prepared smoke into executed smoke, and they are not source certification, airport/runway availability truth, target-behavior proof, route-impact claims, safety conclusions, causation claims, or action guidance.
- Aerospace evidence-timeline/export notes remain review/accounting only; timeline order is not causation, and distinct observed, forecast, archive, reference, anonymous-comparison, and advisory/source-reported contexts must stay separate.
- Aerospace fusion-snapshot input notes remain metadata/accounting inputs only; they keep observed, forecast, advisory/source-reported, archive, reference, anonymous-comparison, derived, and validation context distinct for a future cross-domain Source Fusion Snapshot and do not replace source-specific aerospace surfaces.
- Aerospace report-brief package notes remain report-ready metadata/accounting only; they turn fusion input into bounded observe/orient/prioritize/explain sections and do not replace source-specific aerospace surfaces or existing aerospace review/export/timeline helpers.
- Aerospace selected-target operational question packet notes remain metadata/accounting only; they answer what context exists right now while keeping AWC, FAA NAS, OpenSky comparison, VAAC, SWPC, NCEI archive, and observed geomagnetism distinct and do not imply intent, route impact, failure, threat, causation, safety conclusion, or action recommendation.
- Aerospace space-weather continuity package notes remain metadata/accounting only; they keep current advisories, archival metadata, and observed geomagnetism distinct and do not imply GPS/radio/satellite/aircraft failure, outage, route impact, causation, or operational consequence.
- Aerospace VAAC advisory report-package notes remain report-ready metadata/accounting only; they preserve advisory/source-reported VAAC context from Washington, Anchorage, and Tokyo without implying route impact, aircraft exposure, ash-plume precision beyond the source, operational consequence, or action recommendation.
- Aerospace package-coherence notes remain metadata/accounting only; they exist to avoid duplicating the existing review/export/timeline packages while checking parity across them.
- Aerospace source-readiness families remain review-oriented context-family summaries only, not severity scores or operational consequence statements.
- Aerospace export-readiness notes remain export-context completeness summaries only; they are not source reliability certification.
- Aerospace context-report notes remain bounded explainability/export summaries only; they are not proof statements or action guidance.
- Aerospace review-queue notes remain review-ordering summaries only; they are not operational urgency or action guidance.
- No source slice should claim:
  - flight intent
  - satellite failure
  - GPS failure
  - radio failure
  - impact risk
  - causation between contextual sources and target behavior

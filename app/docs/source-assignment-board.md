# Phase 2 Source Assignment Board

This board is the current truth for Phase 2 source status across the existing brief packs, prompt index, and ownership map.

Use it to answer:

- what is already implemented
- what is safe to assign next
- what still needs verification
- what should stay deferred
- how Gather should update status after agent reports

## Current Next Assignments

- Geospatial next: the `2026-05-05 19:41 America/Chicago` `NOAA nowCOAST` plus `National Weather Service Alerts API` wave is now landed backend-first; the next clean user-priority follow-on is `GeoNames`, while `meteoalarm-atom-feeds`, `geoboundaries-admin`, `Natural Earth`, and `USGS earthquakes` stay follow-on-only or duplicate
- Geospatial occupancy note: `Evidence Timeline`, `Review Packet Export`, `Source Candidate Intake Queue`, `Source Health Console`, and `Attention Queue Unifier` are no longer blank feature spaces; future geospatial work should target cross-domain normalization or one fresh bounded source, not another renamed domain-local helper
- Marine next: the `Navtex` source wave is now landed backend-first; keep warning/context semantics explicit and use only one small static-context follow-on if Manager explicitly prefers it over reassignment
- Aerospace next: the `GPSJam` source wave is now landed backend-first; keep it separate from AWC, FAA NAS, OpenSky, SWPC, NCEI, VAAC, and selected-target semantics, and treat smoke/workflow closure as the next honest follow-on
- Features/Webcam next: the bounded `OpenStreetMap` / `Overpass` / `Geofabrik` lead-support wave is now completed source-ops evidence; keep it below implementation proof and use only one bounded candidate follow-on if the lane is reopened
- Features/Webcam candidate discovery note: [`webcam-global-camera-candidate-batch-2026-05.md`](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/webcam-global-camera-candidate-batch-2026-05.md) records a May 2026 batch of global no-auth camera candidates. Treat it as candidate-only source-ops evidence, not implementation, validation, activation, or scheduling proof.
- Data next: the bounded `2026-05-05 20:22 America/Chicago` institutional follow-on for `SEC EDGAR` and `USAspending` is now implemented backend-first; next Data AI work should wait for reassignment rather than reopening completed topic/report helpers or widening into company-dossier behavior
- Gather next: verify `eea-air-quality`, `singapore-nea-weather`, `esa-neocc-close-approaches`, `imo-epos-geohazards`, and the remaining Batch 5 `needs-verification` sources before promoting any of them to assignment-ready, and treat Wonder/OSINT Framework audit artifacts as candidate-routing input only via [osint-framework-intake-routing-memo.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/osint-framework-intake-routing-memo.md)
- Gather candidate-routing note: use [source-candidate-to-brief-routing-matrix.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-candidate-to-brief-routing-matrix.md) before converting any Wonder, Atlas, source-discovery, or candidate-only webcam lead into a Gather brief or quick-assign packet
- Connect next: the `18:49` Source Discovery/runtime consolidation checkpoint is completed; keep provider/runtime boundary truth as runtime-only evidence, keep the Atlas runtime operator-console slice as peer/runtime input pending Connect validation, and keep the active `19:15` shared reporting-loop contract wave in-progress until Connect replaces its stub entry
- User-priority routing note: use [source-user-priority-routing-governance-packet.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-user-priority-routing-governance-packet.md) for bucket truth and [source-user-priority-follow-on-shortlist.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-user-priority-follow-on-shortlist.md) for the next deconflicted handoff set; keep discovery-only, browser-only, and safety-sensitive items below implementation proof.
- Manager planning note: use [phase2-next-biggest-wins-packet.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/phase2-next-biggest-wins-packet.md) for the current top-three larger handoffs per controlled lane.
- Next-after-next note: use [phase2-next-after-next-shortlist.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/phase2-next-after-next-shortlist.md) once the current larger controlled wave is closed and Manager needs the next compact bounded shortlist.
- Reporting-desk note: use [reporting-desk-phase2-roadmap.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/reporting-desk-phase2-roadmap.md) for the current question-driven reporting direction, reporting-input map, and stale-source routing repairs.
- Base-earth note: Batch 7 geography/base-earth sources are now in the registry, but should be assigned as narrow static/reference slices only; do not combine bathymetry, relief, soil, land-cover, hydrography, glaciers, tectonics, and volcano references into one broad platform task.
- Data AI note: RSS/Atom source candidates now exist across the starter, official cyber, infrastructure/status, OSINT/investigations, rights/civic/digital-policy, fact-checking/disinformation, and broader Batch 3 context families; the implemented waves above are already backend-first, so the next expansion should be one bounded remaining family only rather than broader polling.

Status caution:

- Several sources below are `implemented` and clearly contract-tested in repo code.
- They are not `validated` unless workflow-level validation has been explicitly recorded.
- Treat `contract-tested` as stronger than `implemented`, but still weaker than `workflow-validated` or `validated`.
- `workflow-validated` here means fixture-backed contract, smoke, and export workflow evidence has been recorded.
- It does not mean fully validated, live validated, or upstream-source-live validated.
- `data` is now a distinct implementation lane from `gather` and `connect`.
- `gather` owns governance and status truth; `data` owns bounded implementation for assigned public internet-information sources; `connect` owns repo-wide validation and blocker truth.
- source discovery, source reputation, claim-outcome memory, and shared source-memory surfaces create candidates and review evidence only; they do not promote a source to `implemented`, `workflow-validated`, `validated`, or `fully validated`.
- Source Discovery `structure-scan`, knowledge-node clustering/backfill, review-claim import/apply, Wave LLM provider/runtime controls, and media/OCR interpretation surfaces are candidate-routing, review, derived-evidence, or runtime-boundary helpers only; they do not create source-validation proof by themselves.
- Wonder Stack Exchange and seed-packet discovery are candidate/review discovery input only; they do not create source approval, implementation proof, or workflow-validation proof.
- Atlas media-geolocation hardening is peer and derived-evidence input only; it does not create source-validation proof by itself.
- Wonder archive-index scan, mailing-list archive adapters, and curated directory or regional-portal scan are candidate/review/runtime discovery input only; they do not create source approval, implementation proof, or workflow-validation proof.
- Safety-sensitive note: identity or username enumeration utilities such as `Sherlock`, `Maigret`, `WhatsMyName`, and `Blackbird` are not default product-source lanes and should remain do-not-route-directly unless an explicit safety-governed exception is later approved.

## Source Discovery Governance

Use these docs before routing any source-discovery, source-reputation, claim-outcome, or shared source-memory work:

- [source-discovery-reputation-governance-packet.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-discovery-reputation-governance-packet.md)
- [source-discovery-platform-plan.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-discovery-platform-plan.md)
- [source-candidate-to-brief-routing-matrix.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-candidate-to-brief-routing-matrix.md)
- [source-discovery-agent-framework.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-discovery-agent-framework.md)
- [osint-framework-intake-routing-memo.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/osint-framework-intake-routing-memo.md)
- [wave-monitor-governance-intake.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/wave-monitor-governance-intake.md)
- [source-validation-status.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-validation-status.md)
- [source-workflow-validation-plan.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-workflow-validation-plan.md)

Routing rule:

- `gather` owns governance, allowed states, and status truth
- `connect` owns shared runtime/storage boundary truth and release-readiness truth
- `data` owns feed-family and public-internet source-candidate semantics
- domain agents own domain-specific candidate evaluation
- `ui-integration` is later-only after shared contracts stabilize
- Atlas remains important user-directed implementation input, not Manager-controlled ownership proof

Do-not-do warning:

- do not treat candidate discovery, reputation learning, or claim-outcome memory as automatic source validation or automatic permission to schedule, poll, or trust a source

## OSINT Framework Intake

Use these docs before routing any Wonder or OSINT Framework candidate into a real 11Writer source lane:

- [osint-framework-intake-routing-memo.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/osint-framework-intake-routing-memo.md)
- [source-discovery-reputation-governance-packet.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-discovery-reputation-governance-packet.md)
- [source-discovery-platform-plan.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-discovery-platform-plan.md)

Routing rule:

- Wonder audit artifacts are candidate-routing input only
- OSINT Framework listings are not approval proof, endpoint proof, or assignment-ready proof
- `gather` owns intake truth and candidate bucketing
- `data` or a domain owner may only take over after one bounded machine-readable endpoint is pinned cleanly

Do-not-do warning:

- do not promote an OSINT Framework listing into assignment-ready, implemented, or validated status without the normal endpoint, policy, and fixture-first review path

## Candidate-To-Brief Routing

Use this before converting any surviving Wonder, Atlas, source-discovery, or webcam candidate lead into a Gather brief or quick-assign packet:

- [source-candidate-to-brief-routing-matrix.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-candidate-to-brief-routing-matrix.md)
- [osint-framework-intake-routing-memo.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/osint-framework-intake-routing-memo.md)
- [source-discovery-reputation-governance-packet.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-discovery-reputation-governance-packet.md)

Routing rule:

- candidate-only evidence stays candidate-only until the minimum packet evidence is explicit
- the minimum packet evidence is:
  - official docs URL
  - machine endpoint
  - no-auth/no-signup status
  - source owner
  - evidence basis
  - source mode expectation
  - caveats
  - export metadata expectation
  - do-not-do list

Do-not-do warning:

- do not let candidate popularity, discovery frequency, or runtime presence bypass the normal brief/packet gate

## Data AI RSS Intake

Data AI RSS candidates live in [data-ai-rss-source-candidates.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/data-ai-rss-source-candidates.md). They do not imply code exists yet.

Manager note:

- Validated working RSS/Atom feeds found: 277 total, including 115 additional Batch 2 feeds and 110 additional Batch 3 feeds
- Recommended first code slice:
  1. `cisa-cybersecurity-advisories`
  2. `cisa-ics-advisories`
  3. `sans-isc-diary`
  4. `cloudflare-status`
  5. `gdacs-alerts`
- Active-lane rule:
  - keep the currently implemented feed families bounded and use [data-ai-rss-batch3-routing-packets.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/data-ai-rss-batch3-routing-packets.md) for the next remaining wave only
- Current repo-local implementation truth:
  - the five-feed starter bundle is now implemented backend-first with a bounded aggregate route, typed contracts, fixtures, tests, and prompt-injection fixture coverage
  - the official cyber advisory wave is implemented backend-first on the same bounded aggregate route
  - the infrastructure/status wave is implemented backend-first on the same bounded aggregate route
  - the OSINT/investigations wave is implemented backend-first on the same bounded aggregate route
  - the rights/civic/digital-policy wave is implemented backend-first on the same bounded aggregate route
  - the fact-checking/disinformation wave is implemented backend-first on the same bounded aggregate route
  - the official/public advisories wave is implemented backend-first on the same bounded aggregate route
  - the scientific/environmental context wave is implemented backend-first on the same bounded aggregate route
  - the cyber-vendor/community follow-on wave is implemented backend-first on the same bounded aggregate route
  - the cyber/internet platform-watch wave is implemented backend-first on the same bounded aggregate route
  - the world-news awareness wave is implemented backend-first on the same bounded aggregate route
  - the internet-governance/standards context wave is implemented backend-first on the same bounded aggregate route
  - the public-institution/world-context wave is implemented backend-first on the same bounded aggregate route
  - treat it as contract-tested, not workflow-validated
  - use [data-ai-feed-rollout-ladder.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/data-ai-feed-rollout-ladder.md) plus [data-ai-next-routing-after-family-summary.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/data-ai-next-routing-after-family-summary.md) for staged follow-on sequencing instead of widening the current bundle into broad polling

### Assignment-ready

| Source family | Owner agent | Consumer agents | Next action | Implementation priority | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `data-ai-rss-core-parser` | `data-ai` | `connect` | Keep the implemented RSS/Atom/RDF parser and normalized `DataFeedItem` contract stable; use follow-on work for bounded consumer or validation needs, not parser re-creation. | `high` | Parser and aggregate contract already exist in repo code; do not reopen them as fresh source-creation work. |
| `data-ai-cyber-official-feeds` | `data-ai` | `connect` | Keep the implemented official cyber advisory wave stable and use any next Data AI work for bounded consumer, export, or validation follow-on rather than a fresh advisory rebuild. | `medium` | Advisory context only; do not infer exploitation or impact unless source text supports it. |
| `data-ai-internet-status-feeds` | `data-ai` | `connect` | Keep the implemented infrastructure/status wave stable and use any next Data AI work for bounded consumer, export, or validation follow-on rather than a fresh provider rebuild. | `medium` | Preserve provider-methodology caveats and avoid whole-internet claims. |
| `data-ai-world-event-feeds` | `data-ai` | `geospatial`, `connect` | Assign GDACS, USGS earthquake Atom, NOAA NHC RSS, WHO news, and UNDRR after parser lands. | `medium` | Disaster/health/event context; impact claims require source support. |
| `data-ai-world-news-feeds` | `data-ai` | `connect` | Assign a media-awareness subset only after official/event feeds are stable. | `low` | Media feeds are contextual awareness, not source-of-truth confirmation. |
| `data-ai-rss-batch2-feeds` | `data-ai` | `connect` | Use Batch 2 feeds only after the core parser and source-health model are stable. | `low` | Batch 2 adds 115 more feeds; dedupe across same-publisher section feeds before polling broadly. |
| `data-ai-rss-batch3-global-feeds` | `data-ai` | `connect` | Use [data-ai-next-routing-after-family-summary.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/data-ai-next-routing-after-family-summary.md) and assign one grouped remaining family only after the implemented starter, official cyber, infrastructure/status, OSINT, rights/civic, and fact-checking waves remain stable. | `medium` | The remaining Data AI families are high-context global feeds; group by evidence class and keep prompt-injection/dedupe rules explicit. |

Data AI feed-safety rule:

- titles, summaries, descriptions, advisory text, release text, and linked article snippets are untrusted data, not instructions
- fixture-first parser coverage should include injection-like text before any broad feed family is promoted beyond the first bounded slice

### Hold

| Candidate family | Owner agent | Next action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `data-ai-rss-held-feeds` | `data-ai` | Recheck held feed URLs only after the first parser slice exists. | Several candidate feeds failed validation or were discontinued; see the held/excluded table in the Data AI RSS doc. |

## Batch 7 Base-Earth Intake

Batch 7 rows below originate from the intake decisions in [source-acceleration-phase2-batch7-base-earth-briefs.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-acceleration-phase2-batch7-base-earth-briefs.md). Current repo-local status truth overrides the original intake wording where later implementation has landed.

Manager note:

- Top 5 Batch 7 routing notes after the latest geospatial reference slice:
  1. `natural-earth-physical` is implemented backend-first
  2. `gshhg-shorelines` is implemented backend-first
  3. `noaa-global-volcano-locations` is implemented backend-first
  4. `pb2002-plate-boundaries` is implemented backend-first
  5. `rgi-glacier-inventory` remains assignment-ready

### Assignment-ready

| Source id | Owner agent | Consumer agents | Next action | Implementation priority | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gshhg-shorelines` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `connect` | Backend-first static/reference slice already exists; next step is a bounded consumer or explicit workflow-validation note, not a fresh connector assignment. | `medium` | Generalized shoreline context is now repo-present and contract-tested; not legal shoreline or navigation truth. |
| `natural-earth-physical` | `geospatial` | `connect` | Backend-first static/reference slice already exists; next step is a bounded consumer or explicit workflow-validation note, not a fresh connector assignment. | `medium` | Physical cartography slice is now repo-present and contract-tested; avoid duplicate connector work or live-hazard framing. |
| `glims-glacier-outlines` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `connect` | Assign selected-AOI glacier outline lookup with GLIMS IDs and analysis metadata. | `medium` | Multi-temporal outlines; do not imply current glacier extent without dates. |
| `rgi-glacier-inventory` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `connect` | Assign one region-scoped glacier inventory summary. | `medium` | Snapshot inventory; not glacier-by-glacier change-rate evidence. |
| `pb2002-plate-boundaries` | `geospatial` | `aerospace`, `connect` | Backend-first static/reference slice already exists; next step is a bounded consumer or explicit workflow-validation note, not a fresh connector assignment. | `medium` | Static scientific model is now repo-present and contract-tested; not live hazard truth. |
| `noaa-global-volcano-locations` | `geospatial` | `aerospace`, `connect` | Backend-first static/reference slice already exists; next step is a bounded consumer or explicit workflow-validation note, not a fresh connector assignment. | `medium` | Reference metadata is now repo-present and contract-tested, not current eruptive status. |
| `smithsonian-gvp-volcanoes` | `geospatial` | `aerospace`, `connect` | Assign public export/search metadata enrichment keyed by GVP ID/name. | `medium` | Use public export/search data only; do not scrape volcano profile pages. |

### Tier-2 Complex

| Source id | Owner agent | Consumer agents | Next action | Implementation priority | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gebco-bathymetry` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `connect` | Assign one pinned grid version for selected-point or bounded-AOI depth lookup. | `medium` | Large static raster; preserve TID/source metadata where used. |
| `noaa-etopo-global-relief` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `connect` | Assign one bounded relief/depth lookup or one coarse baseline tile family. | `medium` | Keep bedrock/ice-surface variants explicit. |
| `gmrt-multires-topography` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `connect` | Assign one public OGC overlay or selected-area export path. | `medium` | Uneven high-resolution coverage; enrichment only. |
| `emodnet-bathymetry` | `marine` | `geospatial`, `connect` | Assign one public DTM/WCS/WMS route for a bounded European marine AOI. | `medium` | Public products/services only; request-access survey datasets are not approved. |
| `hydrosheds-hydrorivers` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `connect` | Assign nearest-river lookup or one regional river-network extract. | `medium` | Static modeled network; discharge attributes are contextual estimates. |
| `hydrosheds-hydrolakes` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `connect` | Assign selected lake/reservoir context or nearest-lake lookup. | `medium` | Static estimates; not lake-level observations. |
| `grwl-river-widths` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `connect` | Assign simplified summary-stat vector product for one region. | `medium` | Very large downloads; mean-discharge morphology only. |
| `glwd-wetlands` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `connect` | Assign GLWD-3 coarse class lookup or GLWD-1 large-lake/reservoir slice. | `low` | Coarse static wetland/waterbody context; not live flood extent. |
| `isric-soilgrids` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `connect` | Assign one WCS/WebDAV-backed property/depth lookup for a point or small AOI. | `medium` | Model predictions with uncertainty; do not use paused/beta REST API first. |
| `fao-hwsd-soils` | `geospatial` | `connect` | Assign coarse global soil unit/property lookup for selected AOI. | `low` | Coarse global fallback; preserve version and depth-layer semantics. |
| `esa-worldcover-landcover` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `features-webcam`, `connect` | Assign selected-point or viewport land-cover lookup from one product year only. | `medium` | 2020/2021 algorithm differences must not be treated as direct observed change. |

### Needs-verification

| Source id | Owner agent | Next action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allen-coral-atlas-reefs` | `marine` | Pin a direct public no-auth downloadable product route before assignment. | Public products are verified, but normal Atlas downloads appear account-oriented and Earth Engine requires registration. |
| `usgs-tectonic-boundaries-reference` | `geospatial` | Pin a stable global machine-readable public-domain GIS route before assignment. | Public-domain USGS educational/reference maps are verified, but image/PDF tracing is not allowed. |

## Batch 5 Intake

Batch 5 rows below originate from the intake decisions in [source-acceleration-phase2-batch5-briefs.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-acceleration-phase2-batch5-briefs.md). Current repo-local status truth overrides the original intake wording where later implementation has landed.

Manager note:

- Top 3 fresh assignment-ready Batch 5 handoffs after current repo reconciliation:
  1. `ireland-opw-waterlevel`
  2. `geoboundaries-admin`
  3. `natural-earth-reference`

### Assignment-ready

| Source id | Owner agent | Consumer agents | Next action | Implementation priority | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ireland-opw-waterlevel` | `marine` | `geospatial`, `connect` | Assign station metadata plus latest readings only from the documented machine endpoints. | `medium` | Provisional hydrometric observations only; not flood-impact confirmation. |
| `ireland-epa-wfd-catchments` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `connect` | Assign catchment metadata and search only. | `low` | Reference/context layer only, not a live event feed. |
| `natural-earth-reference` | `geospatial` | `connect` | Assign one ADM0 static reference layer only. | `low` | Static reference layer; preserve de facto boundary caveat. |
| `geoboundaries-admin` | `geospatial` | `connect` | Assign one `gbOpen` country/ADM1 metadata query only. | `low` | Strong reference source if it stays country-scoped and license-aware. |

### Implemented follow-on only

| Source id | Owner agent | Consumer agents | Next action | Implementation priority | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dmi-forecast-aws` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `features-webcam`, `connect` | Backend-first slice already exists; next step is a bounded consumer or explicit workflow-validation note, not a fresh connector assignment. | `medium` | Forecast context only; do not treat model output as observation truth. |
| `met-eireann-forecast` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `connect` | Backend-first slice already exists; next step is a bounded consumer or explicit workflow-validation note, not a fresh connector assignment. | `medium` | Forecast context only; do not treat model output as observed conditions. |
| `met-eireann-warnings` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `connect` | Backend-first slice already exists; next step is a bounded consumer or explicit workflow-validation note, not a fresh connector assignment. | `medium` | Advisory/contextual only; do not infer impact or damage from warning colors. |
| `portugal-ipma-open-data` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `connect` | Backend-first slice already exists; next step is a bounded consumer, base-earth-adjacent export composition input, or explicit workflow-validation note, not a fresh connector assignment. | `medium` | Advisory/contextual only; do not infer impact, damage, or certainty from warning text alone. |
| `bc-wildfire-datamart` | `geospatial` | `connect` | Backend-first slice already exists; next step is a bounded consumer or explicit workflow-validation note, not a fresh connector assignment. | `medium` | Public API is clear for fire-weather context, not wildfire incident truth. |
| `usgs-geomagnetism` | `geospatial` | `aerospace`, `connect` | Backend-first slice is already implemented; next step is a bounded first consumer or explicit workflow-validation note, not a fresh connector assignment. | `medium` | Context-only geophysical observations; do not infer downstream impacts. |

### Needs-verification

| Source id | Owner agent | Next action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `belgium-rmi-warnings` | `geospatial` | Verify whether an official machine-readable warning feed exists beyond public warning pages. | Avoid HTML-first parsing if a cleaner official feed exists. |
| `mbta-gtfs-realtime` | `features-webcam` | Confirm a durable no-key production path before assignment. | Docs mention no-key experimentation, but current no-signup production path is still not clear enough. |

### Deferred

| Source id | Owner agent | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `canada-open-data-registry` | `gather` | Discovery/catalog source only; not final source truth. |
| `noaa-ncei-access-data` | `geospatial` | Public APIs exist, but the family is too broad for a safe first connector slice. |
| `noaa-ncei-space-weather-portal` | `aerospace` | Backend-first archival/context slice plus bounded consumer/export path already exist; next step is workflow evidence, not a fresh connector assignment. |
| `fdsn-public-seismic-metadata` | `gather` | Better treated as standards/discovery work than as a generic multi-provider connector. |

### Rejected

| Source id | Owner agent | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gadm-boundaries` | `geospatial` | Current data licensing is restricted to academic and other non-commercial use. |
| `mta-gtfs-realtime` | `features-webcam` | Official MTA realtime access requires an API key. |
| `portugal-eredes-outages` | `geospatial` | Public outage access was not pinned to a stable no-signup machine endpoint and the remaining practical paths appear tied to interactive or customer-facing flows. |
| `opensanctions-bulk` | `gather` | Non-commercial content licensing and weak fit for the current spatial/event-source lane. |

## Batch 6 Intake

Batch 6 rows below originate from the intake decisions in [source-acceleration-phase2-batch6-briefs.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-acceleration-phase2-batch6-briefs.md). Current repo-local status truth overrides the original intake wording where later implementation has landed.

Compact handoff packets for the top Batch 6 sources now live in [source-quick-assign-packets-batch6.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-quick-assign-packets-batch6.md).

Manager note:

- Historical top 5 Batch 6 intake handoffs from the classification pass:
  1. `geosphere-austria-warnings`
  2. `washington-vaac-advisories`
  3. `taiwan-cwa-aws-opendata`
  4. `bart-gtfs-realtime`
  5. `nasa-power-meteorology-solar`
- Current repo-local status truth overrides that intake ranking where implementation has since landed.

### Needs-verification

| Source id | Owner agent | Next action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `geosphere-austria-datahub` | `geospatial` | Pin one dataset-level machine endpoint before assignment. | Treat the DataHub as a dataset family, not one connector. |
| `poland-imgw-public-data` | `geospatial` | Pin one bounded public weather or hydrology file family before assignment. | Public repository posture looks plausible, but exact machine access needs tighter confirmation. |
| `iaea-ines-news-events` | `geospatial` | Confirm one stable machine-readable event-report path before code work. | Public reporting exists, but HTML-first browsing is not enough. |

### Deferred

| Source id | Owner agent | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ecmwf-open-forecast` | `geospatial` | Valuable public model data, but the first safe slice is still too binary-heavy and product-heavy for this assignment wave. |
| `noaa-nomads-models` | `geospatial` | Public and useful, but product-family sprawl and GRIB-heavy handling make it a poor immediate fit. |
| `noaa-hrrr-model` | `geospatial` | Strong value, but still too infrastructure-heavy and binary-heavy for the current clean-slice bar. |

### Rejected

| Source id | Owner agent | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chmi-swim-aviation-meteo` | `aerospace` | SWIM-branded meteorological services are too likely to rely on restricted or request-access aviation data paths under current rules. |
| `netherlands-ndw-datex-traffic` | `features-webcam` | DATEX II traffic distribution is not clean enough under the no-signup/no-controlled-access rule set. |

## Batch 4 Intake

Batch 4 statuses below are classification-only intake decisions from [source-acceleration-phase2-batch4-briefs.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-acceleration-phase2-batch4-briefs.md). They do not imply code exists yet unless a row now explicitly notes newer repo-present evidence; in those cases, current board truth wins over the older intake label.

### Assignment-ready

| Source id | Owner agent | Consumer agents | Next action | Implementation priority | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `unhcr-refugee-data-finder` | `geospatial` | `connect` | Assign one bounded country or region displacement indicator slice for inspector/context enrichment. | `medium` | Context layer only; do not render as precise event points without source-provided geometry. |
| `worldbank-indicators` | `geospatial` | `connect` | Assign one country indicator family only for baseline environmental or infrastructure context. | `medium` | Annual or periodic baseline context only, not live event evidence. |
| `uk-police-crime` | `geospatial` | `connect` | Assign one bounded street-crime or outcome slice with strong approximation caveats. | `medium` | Approximate/anonymized civic context only; not live incident reporting. |
| `london-air-quality-network` | `geospatial` | `connect` | Assign station metadata plus latest validated observation/index slice only. | `medium` | Keep observed station values separate from any modeled or objective summaries. |
| `bmkg-earthquakes` | `geospatial` | `connect` | Backend-first regional-authority earthquake slice already exists; next step is a bounded consumer or explicit workflow-validation note, not a fresh connector assignment. | `high` | One of the cleanest new Batch 4 event feeds and now repo-present with source-health and free-text hardening. |
| `ga-recent-earthquakes` | `geospatial` | `connect` | Backend-first regional-authority KML earthquake slice already exists; next step is a bounded consumer or explicit workflow-validation note, not a fresh connector assignment. | `medium` | Useful regional-authority supplement and now repo-present if KML parsing stays narrow. |
| `gb-carbon-intensity` | `geospatial` | `connect` | Assign current regional carbon-intensity context plus bounded forecast window. | `medium` | Grid context only; do not infer outages or operational failures. |
| `elexon-insights-grid` | `geospatial` | `connect` | Assign one official public dataset family only. | `medium` | Keep the first slice narrow to avoid catalog sprawl. |

### Needs-verification

| Source id | Owner agent | Next action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `un-population-api` | `geospatial` | Pin one official machine-readable population endpoint before any assignment. | Baseline demographic context remains useful, but the exact public API surface still needs tighter confirmation. |
| `uk-ea-water-quality` | `marine` | Pin one public machine query for sampling points plus latest measurement behavior. | Official family is clear, but the safest first query path still needs verification. |
| `ingv-seismic-fdsn` | `geospatial` | Pin one public event metadata path before assigning an Italy/Mediterranean first slice. | Keep regional-authority value explicit and avoid generic FDSN sprawl. |
| `orfeus-eida-federator` | `geospatial` | Backend-first bounded seismic station-metadata slice already exists; next step is bounded consumer or explicit workflow-validation follow-on, not a fresh connector assignment. | Treat as European network context only, not a replacement for national-source semantics. |
| `germany-smard-power` | `geospatial` | Confirm the first-party machine endpoint for one load/generation family. | Good grid context source once the exact public path is pinned. |
| `france-georisques` | `geospatial` | Pin one public risk-reference dataset query before assignment. | Reference/risk layer only, not a live alert feed. |
| `iom-dtm-public-displacement` | `gather` | Separate direct public machine resources from any form-gated access before assignment. | Public-resource-only intake is acceptable; form-gated flows are not. |

### Deferred

| Source id | Owner agent | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openaq-aws-hourly` | `geospatial` | Open and useful, but archive-scale discovery and provider heterogeneity make it heavier than the current best Phase 2 wins. |
| `usgs-landslide-inventory` | `geospatial` | Valuable reference layer, but large hazard/reference geodata is a poorer immediate fit than narrower event or context feeds. |
| `hdx-ckan-open-resources` | `gather` | Better handled as discovery and public-resource verification work before any narrow connector assignment. |

### Rejected

| Source id | Owner agent | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reliefweb-humanitarian-updates` | `geospatial` | Current API docs indicate a pre-approved `appname` requirement, which violates the no-signup/no-approval rule. |

## Batch 3 Intake

Batch 3 statuses below are classification-only intake decisions from [source-acceleration-phase2-batch3-briefs.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-acceleration-phase2-batch3-briefs.md). They do not imply code exists yet unless repo-local evidence is explicitly called out elsewhere in this board or in the Data AI progress docs.

### Assignment-ready

| Source id | Owner agent | Consumer agents | Next action | Implementation priority | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `metno-locationforecast` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `features-webcam`, `connect` | Assign a narrow backend-only point-forecast slice with controlled `User-Agent` headers. | `medium` | Ready only if production calls stay server-side or otherwise control `User-Agent`. |
| `metno-nowcast` | `geospatial` | `features-webcam`, `connect` | Assign one point nowcast slice with fixture-backed response handling. | `medium` | Treat as short-horizon forecast context, not observed weather. |
| `metno-metalerts-cap` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `features-webcam`, `connect` | Assign current alert feed parsing only. | `medium` | Keep alert semantics separate from forecast products. |
| `nve-flood-cap` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `connect` | Assign a flood-warning-only first slice from the public NVE forecast service. | `medium` | Do not mix with HydAPI or keyed NVE products. |
| `fmi-open-data-wfs` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `features-webcam`, `connect` | Assign one stored-query family only. | `medium` | Respect documented rate limits and avoid WFS sprawl. |
| `opensky-anonymous-states` | `aerospace` | `reference`, `connect` | Assign bounded current-state vectors only. | `medium` | Anonymous access is heavily rate-limited and not authoritative. |
| `emsc-seismicportal-realtime` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `connect` | Backend-first implemented slice already exists; next step is one bounded consumer or explicit workflow-validation note, not a fresh source build. | `medium` | Keep it fixture-first and buffered; do not treat it as executed live-websocket validation. |
| `meteoalarm-atom-feeds` | `geospatial` | `marine`, `features-webcam`, `connect` | Assign one country feed only. | `medium` | Use as normalized warning context, not final national-source truth. |

### Needs-verification

| Source id | Owner agent | Next action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `nve-regobs-natural-hazards` | `geospatial` | Recheck the official read-only public API surface and pin a stable unauthenticated GET path. | Avoid drifting into documented OAuth2 or account-backed flows. |
| `npra-traffic-volume` | `features-webcam` | Pin a stable official machine endpoint before any assignment. | Official dataset pages were visible, but the direct production endpoint was not pinned cleanly enough. |
| `adsb-lol-aircraft` | `aerospace` | Recheck the current public API posture, limits, and stability before assignment. | Community/open aviation source with weaker authority and changing service expectations. |
| `sensor-community-air-quality` | `geospatial` | Verify the official stable machine-readable observation endpoint. | Community/volunteer data should be clearly labeled if approved later. |
| `safecast-radiation` | `geospatial` | Verify the production API path beyond generic download pages. | Community/volunteer source with evidence-language sensitivity. |

### Deferred

| Source id | Owner agent | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `airplanes-live-aircraft` | `aerospace` | Public access exists, but non-commercial/no-SLA posture makes it weak for current Phase 2 implementation. |
| `wmo-swic-cap-directory` | `geospatial` | Discovery directory only, not final event truth. |
| `cap-alert-hub-directory` | `geospatial` | Discovery directory only, not a direct event feed. |

### Duplicate

| Source id | Owner agent | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nasa-gibs-ogc-layers` | `gather` | Current imagery stack already uses NASA GIBS WMTS, so a separate source track would duplicate existing coverage. |

### Rejected

| Source id | Owner agent | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nve-hydapi` | `geospatial` | Official access requires an API key, which violates current no-signup/no-key rules. |
| `npra-datex-traffic` | `features-webcam` | Official access requires registration, which violates current no-signup rules. |
| `jma-public-weather-pages` | `geospatial` | Only public HTML pages were verified, not a stable machine-readable endpoint. |

## How To Update This Board After Agent Reports

- If an agent adds backend route, contracts, fixtures, and tests but frontend integration is incomplete:
  - set status to `in-progress`
- If an agent adds fixture-backed backend work, tests, client integration or minimal UI, export metadata, and the relevant validation passes:
  - set status to `implemented`
- If a source is implemented and full relevant validation passes and the source is usable in workflow:
  - set status to `validated`
- If a source is blocked by repo-wide lint or build failures unrelated to the source itself:
  - keep status at `in-progress`
  - add a blocker note rather than downgrading the source
- If source access becomes uncertain or the official machine endpoint is no longer clear:
  - set or return the source to `needs-verification`
- If the source now requires login, signup, API key, email request, request-access flow, or CAPTCHA:
  - set status to `rejected`
- If an agent report only shows docs work or prompt preparation:
  - do not move beyond `briefed` or `assignment-ready`
- If an agent report only shows route stubs with no fixtures or tests:
  - do not move beyond `assigned` or `in-progress`

## Status Buckets

### Workflow-Validated

- `noaa-coops-tides-currents`
- `noaa-ndbc-realtime`
- `scottish-water-overflows`

Current interpretation:

- these sources are implemented, contract-tested, smoke-covered, and export-metadata-covered
- they are not yet `validated` or `fully validated`
- timestamp-backed `stale` semantics are now explicit for current marine context families
- `unavailable` is now honestly backend-supported in the marine lane where retrieval-failure evidence exists
- `degraded` is now honestly backend-supported only for Scottish Water, France Vigicrues, and Ireland OPW where partial-metadata evidence exists
- CO-OPS and NDBC still should not be described as `degraded` because no honest partial-ingest signal is recorded there
- they should not be treated as live validated from fixture-backed workflow evidence alone

### Implemented

- `usgs-volcano-hazards`
- `bmkg-earthquakes`
- `ga-recent-earthquakes`
- `natural-earth-physical`
- `noaa-global-volcano-locations`
- `geosphere-austria-warnings`
- `nasa-power-meteorology-solar`
- `geonet-geohazards`
- `hko-open-weather`
- `usgs-geomagnetism`
- `canada-cap-alerts`
- `canada-geomet-ogc`
- `bc-wildfire-datamart`
- `noaa-aviation-weather-center-data-api`
- `faa-nas-airport-status`
- `noaa-tsunami-alerts`
- `uk-ea-flood-monitoring`
- `nasa-jpl-cneos`
- `noaa-swpc-space-weather`
- `noaa-ncei-space-weather-portal`
- `opensky-anonymous-states`
- `washington-vaac-advisories`
- `anchorage-vaac-advisories`
- `tokyo-vaac-advisories`
- `nrc-event-notifications`
- `france-vigicrues-hydrometry`
- `taiwan-cwa-aws-opendata`
- `meteoswiss-open-data`
- `nist-nvd-cve`
- `finland-digitraffic`
- `netherlands-rws-waterinfo`

Current interpretation:

- these sources are implemented
- most are contract-tested
- several remain backend-first or consumer-first slices below workflow validation
- none are promoted to `validated` by this board without explicit workflow-validation evidence

### In Progress

- no current source rows

Current interpretation:

- use this bucket only when implementation has clearly started but code presence or bounded source-slice completeness is still not explicit enough for `implemented`

### Assignment-Ready

- `dwd-cap-alerts`
- `dwd-open-weather`
- `unhcr-refugee-data-finder`
- `worldbank-indicators`
- `uk-police-crime`
- `london-air-quality-network`
- `gb-carbon-intensity`
- `elexon-insights-grid`

### Needs-Verification

- `eea-air-quality`
- `singapore-nea-weather`
- `esa-neocc-close-approaches`
- `imo-epos-geohazards`
- `un-population-api`
- `uk-ea-water-quality`
- `ingv-seismic-fdsn`
- `germany-smard-power`
- `france-georisques`
- `iom-dtm-public-displacement`

### Deferred

- `bom-anonymous-ftp`
- `openaq-aws-hourly`
- `usgs-landslide-inventory`
- `hdx-ckan-open-resources`

### Blocked/Rejected

- `reliefweb-humanitarian-updates`

Related registry-side rejected example outside this board scope:

- `iceland-earthquakes`

## Recommended Next Assignments

- Geospatial: the `NOAA nowCOAST` plus `National Weather Service Alerts API` wave is landed; next clean user-priority follow-on is `GeoNames`
- Data: the `CISA KEV`, `RDAP`, and `crt.sh` wave is landed, and the bounded `SEC EDGAR` / `USAspending` institutional follow-on is landed too; next Data move is reassignment or bounded consumer/export closure
- Marine: the `Navtex` wave is landed; next move is reassignment or one bounded static-context follow-on only if explicitly preferred
- Aerospace: the `GPSJam` wave is landed; next move is smoke/workflow closure or reassignment, not a duplicate helper pass
- Features/Webcam: the `OpenStreetMap` / `Overpass` / `Geofabrik` lead-support pass is completed source-ops evidence; keep all map-only leads below implementation proof
- Gather: maintain the user-priority source-list governance packet and keep duplicates, browser-only tools, discovery-only surfaces, and safety-sensitive utilities out of fake implementation routing
- Connect: keep the active `19:15` shared reporting-loop contract wave honest while provider/runtime, Atlas, and Wonder surfaces remain runtime-only or peer-only evidence

## Manager Routing Note

After the current mixed wave settles, the strongest next bounded implementation handoffs are:

1. `geospatial-geonames-follow-on`
2. `gather-hdx-unosat-reliefweb-verification-boundary`
3. `marine-navtex-follow-through`

Why:

- they match the active `2026-05-05 19:41 America/Chicago` domain next-task docs instead of reopening completed reporting helpers
- they are clean no-auth machine-usable lanes with strong Phase 2 reporting-desk value
- they preserve a separate verification/follow-on path for `GeoNames`, `HDX`, `UNOSAT on HDX`, and `ReliefWeb`
- the latest Canada CAP, Canada GeoMet, Meteoalarm, geoBoundaries, and environmental question-briefing work now appear repo-present or completed in progress truth, so they no longer belong in the clean fresh-routing block
- they preserve bounded next-after-next work instead of reopening already implemented reporting-input or warning waves

## Inconsistency Notes

Current planning docs are now closer to aligned, but a few notes remain:

- `faa-nas-airport-status`
  - Earlier prompt docs framed this as ready-to-assign.
  - Repo evidence now supports `implemented`, so the board has been promoted accordingly.
- `noaa-ndbc-realtime`
  - Earlier prompt docs framed this as ready-to-assign.
  - Repo evidence now supports `workflow-validated`, so the board has been promoted accordingly.

  - Marine workflow evidence now supports `workflow-validated`, but not `validated`.
- `france-vigicrues-hydrometry`
  - Earlier planning treated this as assignment-ready.
  - Marine AI progress now supports `implemented` because the backend slice, tests, docs, and bounded hydrology/corridor follow-through are all explicit, but no source-row workflow-validation record is recorded yet.
- `usgs-geomagnetism`
  - Earlier Batch 5 planning treated this as assignment-ready.
  - Geospatial AI progress now supports `implemented`, but only as a backend-first context slice; no workflow validation is implied.

  - Geospatial AI progress now supports `implemented`, but only as backend-first static/reference slices and not as workflow-validated map/reference packages.
- `nist-nvd-cve`
  - Earlier Batch 6 planning treated this as assignment-ready.
  - Data AI progress now supports `implemented`, but only as a backend-first bounded CVE-detail slice with conservative CVE-context composition and prompt-injection-safe fixture coverage.
- `noaa-ncei-space-weather-portal`
  - Earlier Batch 5 planning treated this as deferred archive/context backlog work.
  - Aerospace AI progress now supports `implemented`, with backend contracts plus a bounded client/context/export consumer path, but not workflow validation.
- `nrc-event-notifications`
  - Earlier Batch 6 planning treated this as assignment-ready.

  - Geospatial AI progress now supports `implemented`, but only as a backend-first AWS-file slice; no workflow validation is implied.
- `anchorage-vaac-advisories` and `tokyo-vaac-advisories`
  - Earlier Batch 6 planning treated these as assignment-ready.
  - Aerospace AI progress now supports `implemented` because the bounded three-VAAC consumer/export package is in repo code, but workflow-validation evidence is still missing.
- `finland-digitraffic`
  - Earlier planning treated this as assignment-ready and still used `candidate prep` wording in a few routing notes.
  - Features/Webcam AI progress now supports `implemented`, with list/detail/freshness interpretation coverage already in repo code.
- Aerospace validation wording
  - Older routing language implied generic build drift as the main blocker.
  - Current Connect and Aerospace progress now narrow the blocker to executed browser smoke on a host where Playwright can launch, currently classified as `windows-browser-launch-permission` on this machine.
- Marine source-health wording
  - Older docs treated `unavailable` and `degraded` as mostly future-state gaps.
  - Current Marine AI progress now supports honest backend `unavailable` handling across the five active marine context families and honest `degraded` handling only for Scottish Water, France Vigicrues, and Ireland OPW.
- Features/Webcam source-ops packaging
  - Source-ops export-summary aggregate-line bundling and the minimal review-queue export bundle now exist as backend-only workflow helpers.
  - They are workflow-supporting package evidence, not source validation proof for any external source.
- Cross-lane helper packages
  - Data AI family-overview, environmental family-overview/export, marine issue-export/coherence, aerospace gap-queue/current-vs-archive, and Features/Webcam evidence-packet selector/export helpers now exist as workflow-supporting planning surfaces.

  - It remains broad/shared until ownership is intentionally assigned; Atlas progress is important implementation input, not Manager-controlled ownership proof.
- Chokepoint intelligence routing
  - Any future chokepoint package must stay source-backed, caveated, and non-targeting.
  - Route it through [chokepoint-intelligence-governance-packet.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/chokepoint-intelligence-governance-packet.md) rather than improvising corridor, reroute, anchorage, or blockade semantics from sparse public signals.
- `noaa-tsunami-alerts`
  - Earlier planning treated it as started from registry and prompt readiness.
  - Repo evidence now supports `implemented`.
- `uk-ea-flood-monitoring`
  - Earlier planning treated it as assignment-ready.
  - Repo evidence now supports `implemented`.
- `nasa-jpl-cneos`
  - Earlier planning treated it as assignment-ready.
  - Repo evidence now supports `implemented` at the source-slice level, though additional UI follow-ons may still be useful.
- `validated`
  - This board does not promote any source to `validated` in this docs pass because Gather did not rerun the relevant validation suite here.
  - Promote from `implemented` to `validated` only when passing workflow-level validation is explicitly recorded.

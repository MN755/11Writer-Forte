# Source Workflow Validation Plan

This plan defines what each implemented-but-not-validated Phase 2 source still needs before it can be promoted beyond `implemented`.

Purpose:

- keep `implemented` separate from `workflow-validated`
- define the missing evidence for each source
- prevent over-promotion on the assignment board
- give domain agents and Connect AI a deterministic validation bundle

Related docs:

- [source-assignment-board.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-assignment-board.md)
- [source-validation-status.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-validation-status.md)
- [source-prompt-index.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-prompt-index.md)

Important rules:

- Do not promote any source in this document.
- This plan defines required evidence only.
- `implemented` means the slice exists in code.
- `workflow-validated` requires explicit workflow evidence.
- `fully validated` requires workflow evidence plus source-health and export behavior confirmation.
- Source discovery creates source candidates and starts source-memory learning; a discovered candidate is not an implemented source, validated source, live source, or scheduled connector.

Source discovery platform update:

- [source-discovery-platform-plan.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-discovery-platform-plan.md:1) defines 7Po8-style source discovery as a core 11Writer platform capability.
- [source-discovery-agent-framework.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-discovery-agent-framework.md:1) defines bounded discovery jobs, candidate-state handling, and no-hidden-crawler rules for implementation lanes.
- [source-discovery-reputation-governance-packet.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-discovery-reputation-governance-packet.md:1) defines the compact policy boundary for candidate states, reputation observations, claim outcomes, and shared source-memory routing.
- Discovery outputs must be tracked as candidate/source-review/source-memory evidence, not as source implementation proof.
- Any discovered candidate must preserve provenance, access result, machine-readability result, caveats, policy state, source-health state, source class, source reputation basis, wave-fit basis, duplicate checks, and owner recommendation before it can be routed for implementation.
- Correctness reputation must be evaluated separately from mission relevance.
- Static sources, live sources, full-text articles, social/image evidence, official sources, and community sources need different scoring and validation evidence.
- Claim outcomes such as confirmed, contradicted, corrected, outdated, unresolved, and not-applicable should drive learned source reputation.
- Validation promotion still requires the normal workflow-validation bundle below.
- Current repo-local source-memory routes and persistence are shared candidate/review/runtime evidence only; they do not directly create implemented or workflow-validated source rows.
- Source Discovery `structure-scan`, knowledge-node clustering/backfill, review-claim import/apply, Wave LLM provider/runtime controls, and media/OCR interpretation surfaces are candidate-routing, review, derived-evidence, or runtime-boundary helpers only; they do not create workflow-validation proof by themselves.

Marine workflow update:

- [marine-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/marine-workflow-validation.md:1) now records explicit workflow-validation evidence for:
  - `noaa-coops-tides-currents`
  - `noaa-ndbc-realtime`
  - `scottish-water-overflows`
- Explicit backend hardening evidence now also exists for:
  - `health=empty` on empty results
  - explicit fixture `sourceMode` on empty responses
  - `health=disabled` for disabled/non-fixture behavior
  - source-level caveat presence
  - request validation errors for invalid radius/coordinates
  - source-specific evidence-basis semantics
  - honest backend `unavailable` handling across the active marine context families
  - honest backend `degraded` handling only where partial-metadata evidence exists
- Treat those three as `workflow-validated` for status-tracking purposes.
- They still remain below `fully validated` and should not be treated as live validated from this evidence alone.
- `france-vigicrues-hydrometry` now has implemented backend-first source evidence plus completed hydrology/corridor report-follow-through in Marine AI progress, but it still remains below `workflow-validated` because no explicit source-row workflow-validation record is recorded yet.
- `netherlands-rws-waterinfo` now also has a completed bounded helper/export follow-on in Marine AI progress, but it still remains below `workflow-validated` because no explicit workflow-validation record is recorded yet.
- Marine AI progress now also records a landed backend-first `navtex-context` slice with helper regression, build/lint, export metadata, and marine smoke evidence; keep it at `implemented` until an explicit source-row workflow-validation note is recorded.

Aerospace workflow update:

- [aerospace-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-validation.md:1) now records explicit workflow-validation goals and export expectations for:
  - `noaa-aviation-weather-center-data-api`

- Aerospace AI progress now also records workflow-supporting helper paths for:
  - `aerospaceContextReviewQueue`
  - `aerospaceContextReviewExportBundle`
  - `aerospaceWorkflowReadinessPackage`
- Backend contract tests, server compile, frontend lint, and frontend build are explicitly recorded as passing for the current aerospace lane.
- Executed browser smoke is still not recorded on this host because Playwright launch is currently classified as `windows-browser-launch-permission` before app assertions.
- Treat the five aerospace sources above as `implemented` and clearly `contract-tested`, but not `workflow-validated` from this evidence alone.
- Aerospace AI progress now also records a landed backend-first `gpsjam-context` slice with deterministic regression coverage and prepared smoke assertions; keep it at `implemented` until executed workflow smoke is recorded.

- Data AI progress now records backend-first implemented slices for:
  - `cisa-cyber-advisories`
  - `first-epss`
  - `nist-nvd-cve`

  - `who-news`
  - `undrr-news`
  - `nasa-breaking-news`
  - `noaa-news`
  - `esa-news`
  - `fda-news`
- Data AI progress now also records a backend-first cyber-institutional-watch-context wave for:
  - `cisa-news`
  - `jvn-en-new`
  - `debian-security`
  - `microsoft-security-blog`
  - `cisco-talos-blog`
  - `mozilla-security-blog`
  - `github-security-blog`
- All implemented Data feed waves above have fixture-backed routes, tests, compile evidence, and source-specific docs.
- The aggregate starter bundle has a bounded recent-items route, feed definition registry, RSS/Atom/RDF parser coverage, and prompt-injection-like fixture coverage.
- The official cyber advisory wave, infrastructure/status wave, OSINT/investigations wave, rights/civic/digital-policy wave, fact-checking/disinformation wave, official/public advisories wave, scientific/environmental context wave, cyber-vendor/community follow-on wave, internet-governance/standards context wave, public-institution/world-context wave, and cyber-institutional-watch-context wave use the same bounded recent-items route, feed registry, parser coverage, and prompt-injection-like fixture coverage.
- The NVD and CVE-context lane also preserves explicit evidence-class separation between metadata, advisory, prioritization, and discovery/feed text.
- Data AI progress now also records a backend-first review helper route at:
  - `/api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/review`
- Treat that review helper as metadata only, not as source truth or workflow-validation proof.
- Data AI progress now also records a backend-first family review queue route at:
  - `/api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/review-queue`

  - `dataAiSourceIntelligence`
- Data AI progress now also records a completed metadata-only infrastructure/status context package over:
  - `cloudflare-radar`
  - `netblocks`
  - `apnic-blog`
- Treat that consumer as metadata-only workflow support over readiness/review/review-queue surfaces, not as source truth or workflow-validation proof.
- None of these Data lanes should be treated as `workflow-validated` yet because no explicit consumer-path, smoke, or export-workflow validation is recorded.
- The active bounded Data AI feed lane should not be widened into broad polling; use [data-ai-next-routing-after-family-summary.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/data-ai-next-routing-after-family-summary.md) plus [data-ai-rss-batch3-routing-packets.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/data-ai-rss-batch3-routing-packets.md) for the next grouped Batch 3 expansion only after the implemented waves stay stable, starting with official/public advisories rather than reopening implemented fact-checking, OSINT, or rights/civic families.

  - `/api/cameras/source-ops-evidence-packets-handoff-summary`
- Features/Webcam AI progress now also records a workflow-supporting aggregate export surface route at:
  - `/api/cameras/source-ops-export-surface`
- Features/Webcam AI progress now also records `nsw-live-traffic-cameras` and `quebec-mtmd-traffic-cameras` as `candidate-sandbox-importable` only; that is source-ops evidence and not implementation or validation proof.

  - `/api/source-discovery/memory/claim-outcomes`
  - `/api/source-discovery/jobs/seed-url`
  - `/api/source-discovery/jobs/record-source-extract`
  - `/api/source-discovery/health/check`
  - `/api/source-discovery/jobs/expand`
  - `/api/source-discovery/jobs/feed-link-scan`

  - `/api/source-discovery/scheduler/tick`
  - `/api/source-discovery/review/queue`
  - `/api/source-discovery/review/actions`
  - `/api/source-discovery/runtime/status`
- Atlas AI progress now also records a newer Source Discovery Ten-Step backend slice as peer/runtime input only.
- Atlas alerting and current next-task routing now also record a newer runtime operator-console slice as peer/runtime input only pending Connect validation.
- Atlas alerting now also records a media-geolocation peer slice; keep it at derived-evidence or candidate-location input only unless a later controlled validation pass explicitly promotes a narrower surface.
- Wonder alerting now also records bounded Statuspage and Mastodon discovery; keep both at candidate/review discovery input only unless a later controlled validation pass explicitly promotes a narrower surface.
- Wonder alerting now also records Stack Exchange and seed-packet discovery; keep both at candidate/review discovery input only unless a later controlled validation pass explicitly promotes a narrower surface.
- Wonder breadth intake now also records archive-index scan, mailing-list archive adapters, and curated directory or regional-portal scan; keep all three at candidate/review/runtime discovery input only unless a later controlled validation pass explicitly promotes a narrower surface.
- Wonder planning docs now also record Browser Use guidance plus macOS/plugin/connector planning, but those remain peer planning input only and must not change source-validation posture by themselves.
- These helper paths are implemented and useful for review/export workflows, but they should not be treated as external-source workflow validation proof by themselves.
- Current evidence split:
  - scientific/environmental context is implemented and contract-tested on the existing shared Data AI route, but still has no explicit consumer-path or workflow-validation record
  - official/public advisories is implemented and contract-tested on the existing shared Data AI route, but still has no explicit consumer-path or workflow-validation record
  - source-family review queue is implemented and contract-tested as review metadata only, but still has no explicit consumer-path or workflow-validation record
  - Data AI Source Intelligence is implemented as a client-light metadata-only inspector consumer, and its topic/context lens plus export-safe topic lines remain metadata-only workflow support without explicit smoke or manual workflow-validation record
  - the infrastructure/status context package over `cloudflare-radar`, `netblocks`, and `apnic-blog` is now completed workflow-supporting metadata, not the active fresh Data lane
  - the latest completed Data lanes now include the bounded fusion/claim-integrity snapshot and bounded report-brief package over the existing metadata-only Data AI surfaces
  - the next useful Data move is reporting-input coherence, validation/export closure, or one very small topic-coverage follow-on; do not reopen implemented infrastructure/status, completed `world-news-awareness`, `propublica`, or `global-voices` as fresh source-build lanes
  - cyber-vendor/community follow-on is implemented and contract-tested on the existing shared Data AI route, but still has no explicit consumer-path or workflow-validation record
  - internet-governance/standards context is implemented and contract-tested on the existing shared Data AI route, but still has no explicit consumer-path or workflow-validation record
  - public-institution/world-context is implemented and contract-tested on the existing shared Data AI route, but still has no explicit consumer-path or workflow-validation record
  - Data family overview helper is contract-tested and metadata-oriented only
  - environmental family overview helper, environmental family export helper, environmental context export package, environmental situation snapshot package, environmental weather/observation review queue, and environmental weather/observation export bundle are contract-tested and metadata-oriented only
  - marine issue export bundle plus full export coherence, focused-evidence coherence, timeline/chokepoint coherence regressions, the hydrology/source-health workflow helper, the hydrology/source-health report helper, and `marineFusionSnapshotInput` now have helper regression plus marine smoke/build evidence, but remain helper-package evidence rather than source promotion
  - aerospace context gap queue, current-vs-archive helper, export-coherence helper, context snapshot report helper, and workflow-readiness package have smoke assertions prepared or export-aware evidence, but executed browser smoke is still missing on this host because Playwright launch is blocked by `windows-browser-launch-permission`
  - aerospace context review queue, export bundle, workflow-validation evidence snapshot, and report-brief package have prepared smoke assertions or export-aware accounting evidence, but executed browser smoke is still missing on this host because Playwright launch is blocked by `windows-browser-launch-permission`; preserve the stale assignment-marker caveat on the snapshot helper and the Marine-owned lint-failure note from the last aerospace run
  - Features/Webcam evidence-packet selector, aggregate export bundle, aggregate handoff summary, and aggregate export surface have backend test and documentation evidence, but no explicit end-to-end workflow note yet
  - Features/Webcam sandbox-candidate review-burden/source-health summary has backend test and documentation evidence, and the current candidate-expansion wave appears completed with Baton Rouge/Vancouver/Caltrans candidate-sandbox-importable, Arlington endpoint-verified or feasibility-only, NZTA feasibility-only, and Queensland held; the newer active Features/Webcam lane is now NZTA and Arlington feasibility plus bounded candidate growth, but no explicit end-to-end workflow note is recorded yet
  - Wave Monitor is implemented as a fixture-backed tool surface with focused backend tests and analyst/readiness integration, but it is still not a validated live runtime, scheduler, or source-truth surface
  - source discovery runtime is implemented as a shared backend candidate/reputation surface with focused backend tests plus bounded seed, health, expand, snapshot, reversal, and manual scheduler-tick primitives, but it is still not source implementation proof, source-truth proof, autonomous discovery proof, or workflow-validation proof
  - the Atlas runtime operator-console slice remains peer/runtime input only until Connect records explicit current-state validation; do not route it as workflow-validation proof, source proof, or ownership proof

Wave Monitor tool update:

- [7po8-integration-plan.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/7po8-integration-plan.md:1) plus Atlas AI progress now record a fixture-backed Wave Monitor route at `/api/tools/waves/overview`.
- Atlas AI progress now also records `tool-wave-monitor` integration into analyst evidence-timeline and source-readiness surfaces.
- Treat Wave Monitor as an implemented tool surface and shared architecture input, not a source row and not a separate runtime.
- Persistent storage, live connector execution, scheduler behavior, and Situation Workspace UI still remain outside current implemented proof.
- Atlas evidence should inform governance and validation notes, but Atlas remains user-directed and does not by itself assign stable ownership.

Source discovery memory update:

- [source-discovery-platform-plan.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-discovery-platform-plan.md:1), [source-discovery-agent-framework.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-discovery-agent-framework.md:1), and Atlas AI progress now record a shared source-discovery runtime with overview, candidate-write, claim-outcome update, seed-url, record-source-extract, health-check, bounded expand, feed-link-scan, snapshot, reversal, review queue/actions, runtime status, and manual scheduler-tick routes.
- Current repo evidence supports persistence models, SQLite-backed session wiring, deterministic claim-outcome reputation updates, Wave Monitor candidate seeding, metadata-only health checks, bounded expansion jobs, content snapshots, review queue/actions, runtime status, and reputation reversal.
- Connect AI progress now also records `runtime_scheduler_service.py` as conservative compatibility and status plumbing rather than proof of hidden background scheduling.
- Connect AI progress now also records provider/runtime boundary truth where config presence is exposed by key-source name only, `fixture` remains deterministic and review-only, and `openai`, `OpenRouter`, `Anthropic`, `xAI`, `Google`, `OpenClaw`, and `ollama` remain gated by provider configuration, explicit network permission, and positive request budget.
- Mock-model paths remain deterministic and no provider path is allowed to promote sources, validate claims, activate connectors, or create direct action guidance.
- Treat source discovery memory as an implemented shared candidate/reputation surface and governance input, not a source row and not a validated discovery runtime.
- Autonomous discovery runners, hidden live polling, automatic source approval, and frontend review workflows remain outside current implemented proof.
- Atlas evidence should inform governance and validation notes, but Atlas remains user-directed and does not by itself assign stable ownership or validation status.

- `orfeus-eida-federator` now exists as a backend-first implemented geospatial bounded federated seismic station-metadata slice with fixture-backed contracts and docs.
- `ourairports-reference` now has a bounded selected-target/export consumer through `useOurAirportsReferenceQuery` and `ourairportsReferenceContext`, but it remains below workflow validation.
- `washington-vaac-advisories`, `anchorage-vaac-advisories`, and `tokyo-vaac-advisories` now exist as an implemented aerospace advisory package with fixture-backed contracts plus bounded client/export consumption.
- None of the geospatial/aerospace updates above should be treated as `workflow-validated` yet because no executed consumer-path or smoke/export validation record is explicit on this host.

## Suggested Validation Ownership

- Geospatial sources
  - `Geospatial AI` owns primary workflow validation when the source lands in geospatial layers, inspectors, or evidence flows.
  - `Connect AI` may perform final cross-repo validation confirmation.
- Marine sources
  - `Marine AI` owns primary workflow validation for marine context, summary, and evidence/export behavior.
  - `Connect AI` may perform final cross-repo validation confirmation.
- Aerospace sources
  - `Aerospace AI` owns primary workflow validation for inspector, context, and export behavior.
  - `Connect AI` may perform final cross-repo validation confirmation.
- Cross-domain shared smoke/export
  - `Connect AI` owns release-grade smoke, shared export checks, and repo-wide validation notes.

## Minimum Workflow-Validation Bundle

Every source should have this minimum bundle before promotion to `workflow-validated`:

- backend contract tests pass
- frontend build/lint pass when relevant repo-wide validation is rerun
- source appears in minimal operational UI
- source health or source mode is visible where the slice exposes it
- selected item inspector or detail workflow works if applicable
- export metadata contains source summary and caveat fields
- smoke phase or a deterministic manual workflow is documented
- no overclaiming caveats are missing

## Promotion Rules

### `implemented` -> `workflow-validated`

Required:

- implementation already present in repo
- contract tests pass for the source slice
- minimal UI or operational consumer path is exercised successfully
- source health and freshness state are visible or intentionally absent with documented reason
- export metadata for the source path is checked and recorded if exports exist
- deterministic smoke or manual validation steps are recorded in a doc, agent report, or release note

### `workflow-validated` -> `fully validated`

Required:

- all `workflow-validated` criteria
- explicit confirmation that export metadata is complete and correct
- explicit confirmation that caveat language survives UI and export paths
- explicit confirmation that fixture mode and live-mode assumptions are both documented
- explicit confirmation that source-health behavior is correct under normal and stale/unavailable conditions when the slice exposes those states

## Per-Source Plans

### `usgs-volcano-hazards`

- Owner agent:
  - `Geospatial AI`
- Current validation level:
  - `implemented`
- Existing evidence:

  - current UI or operational consumer path is exercised successfully
  - export metadata is checked and recorded
- Pass criteria for `fully validated`:
  - `workflow-validated` criteria pass
  - source-health wording and caveat survival are explicitly validated
  - fixture/live-mode assumptions are documented together
- Known blockers:
  - executed browser smoke is still missing on this host because Playwright launch is blocked by `windows-browser-launch-permission`

Rationale:

- start with geospatial event and context layers that can gain a first consumer fastest
- validate marine context pair together because they share contract tests and smoke-fixture structure
- validate new backend-first static/reference and CVE-context slices only after one bounded consumer or export path exists
- validate backend-first geospatial and features slices once they gain a first stable consumer path
- validate the three-VAAC package together because the bounded consumer/export wiring is shared
- validate aerospace context sources after marine because their export and workflow evidence is stronger now, but executed browser smoke is still launcher-blocked on this host

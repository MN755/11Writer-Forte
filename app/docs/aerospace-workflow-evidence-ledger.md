# Aerospace Workflow Evidence Ledger

This ledger is scoped to the aerospace / aircraft-satellite subsystem only.
Its purpose is to keep validation truth explicit:
implemented helper surfaces,
machine-readable metadata keys,
backend contract evidence,
client lint/build evidence,
prepared smoke assertions,
and executed smoke evidence are not interchangeable.

## Current Local Posture

- Current assignment-wave acknowledgment:
  the `aerospaceWorkflowValidationEvidenceSnapshot` implementation was already completed before the `2026-05-04 21:43 America/Chicago` manager wave, but an older progress entry recorded it under the stale `2026-05-02 15:47 America/Chicago` assignment marker.
  Aerospace progress truth now explicitly acknowledges that stale-marker mismatch without changing the underlying implementation history.
- Current local validation truth:
  backend aerospace contract suites passed,
  frontend build passed,
  frontend lint passed on the current rerun and the previously reported Marine-owned drift is no longer the active blocker,
  and executed aerospace smoke remains blocked on this Windows host before app assertions because Chromium launch fails with `spawn EPERM`.

## Status Terms

- `executed`:
  a validation step actually ran and passed in the current workflow.
- `prepared`:
  the assertion or validation surface exists, but it has not yet executed in the required environment.
- `blocked`:
  the intended validation step did not reach app assertions because of an environment or launcher boundary.
- `not-applicable`:
  the row is intentionally out of scope for the current workflow.

## Compact Ledger Line

`Aerospace workflow evidence: 4 executed rows | 1 prepared row | 1 blocked row`

Use that line only as a compact accounting summary.
It is not a source-certification, severity, readiness-for-action, or operational-consequence statement.

## Evidence Rows

### Implemented Helper Surfaces

- Status:
  `executed`
- Scope:
  `aerospaceGpsJamContext`
  `aerospaceSourceReadiness`
  `aerospaceSourceReadinessBundle`
  `aerospaceContextGapQueue`
  `aerospaceContextReviewQueue`
  `aerospaceContextReviewExportBundle`
  `aerospaceEvidenceTimelinePackage`
  `aerospaceFusionSnapshotInput`
  `aerospaceReportBriefPackage`
  `aerospaceSelectedTargetOperationalQuestionPacket`
  `aerospaceCurrentAwarenessDigest`
  `aerospaceReportingHandoffContract`
  `aerospaceQuestionBriefingPacket`
  `aerospaceHazardContextConsumerPacket`
  `aerospaceSpaceWeatherContinuityPackage`
  `aerospaceVaacAdvisoryReportPackage`
  `aerospacePackageCoherence`
  `aerospaceCurrentArchiveContext`
  `aerospaceExportCoherence`
  `aerospaceIssueExportBundle`
  `aerospaceContextSnapshotReport`
  `aerospaceWorkflowReadinessPackage`
  `aerospaceWorkflowValidationEvidenceSnapshot`
- Meaning:
  these helpers exist in the client codebase and are typechecked by the current frontend build.
- Caveat:
  implemented helper presence is not the same as executed workflow evidence.

### Snapshot/Export Metadata Keys

- Status:
  `executed`
- Scope:
  `gpsjamContext`
  `aerospaceSourceReadiness`
  `aerospaceSourceReadinessBundle`
  `aerospaceContextGapQueue`
  `aerospaceContextReviewQueue`
  `aerospaceContextReviewExportBundle`
  `aerospaceEvidenceTimelinePackage`
  `aerospaceFusionSnapshotInput`
  `aerospaceReportBriefPackage`
  `aerospaceSelectedTargetOperationalQuestionPacket`
  `aerospaceCurrentAwarenessDigest`
  `aerospaceReportingHandoffContract`
  `aerospaceQuestionBriefingPacket`
  `aerospaceHazardContextConsumerPacket`
  `aerospaceSpaceWeatherContinuityPackage`
  `aerospaceVaacAdvisoryReportPackage`
  `aerospacePackageCoherence`
  `aerospaceCurrentArchiveContext`
  `aerospaceExportCoherence`
  `aerospaceIssueExportBundle`
  `aerospaceContextSnapshotReport`
  `aerospaceWorkflowReadinessPackage`
  `aerospaceWorkflowValidationEvidenceSnapshot`
- Meaning:
  the current frontend export path preserves these machine-readable metadata keys.
- Caveat:
  metadata-key presence in code/build output does not by itself prove browser smoke execution.

### Backend Contract Suites

- Status:
  `executed`
- Scope:
  `test_gpsjam_contracts.py`
  `test_aviation_weather_contracts.py`
  `test_faa_nas_status_contracts.py`
  `test_cneos_contracts.py`
  `test_swpc_contracts.py`
  `test_opensky_contracts.py`
  `test_ncei_space_weather_portal_contracts.py`
- Meaning:
  these suites prove backend route/contract behavior for the current aerospace source slices.
- Caveat:
  backend contract evidence does not prove frontend inspector/export workflows.

### Client Lint/Build Validation

- Status:
  `executed`
- Scope:
  `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`
  `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`
- Meaning:
  the current client tree typechecks and bundles successfully.
- Caveat:
  lint/build success is not executed smoke evidence.

### Prepared Aerospace Smoke Assertions

- Status:
  `prepared`
- Scope:
  the metadata-level aerospace smoke assertions in [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs), including:
  `gpsjamContext`
  `aerospaceSourceReadiness`
  `aerospaceSourceReadinessBundle`
  `aerospaceContextGapQueue`
  `aerospaceContextReviewQueue`
  `aerospaceContextReviewExportBundle`
  `aerospaceEvidenceTimelinePackage`
  `aerospaceFusionSnapshotInput`
  `aerospaceReportBriefPackage`
  `aerospaceSelectedTargetOperationalQuestionPacket`
  `aerospaceCurrentAwarenessDigest`
  `aerospaceReportingHandoffContract`
  `aerospaceQuestionBriefingPacket`
  `aerospaceHazardContextConsumerPacket`
  `aerospaceSpaceWeatherContinuityPackage`
  `aerospaceVaacAdvisoryReportPackage`
  `aerospacePackageCoherence`
  `aerospaceCurrentArchiveContext`
  `aerospaceExportCoherence`
  `aerospaceIssueExportBundle`
  `aerospaceContextSnapshotReport`
  `aerospaceWorkflowReadinessPackage`
  `aerospaceWorkflowValidationEvidenceSnapshot`
- Meaning:
  the smoke runner is ready to assert these metadata surfaces when Chromium launches and reaches app assertions.
- Caveat:
  prepared assertions must not be promoted to workflow-validated evidence until they actually execute.

### Executed Aerospace Smoke Status

- Status:
  `blocked`
- Scope:
  `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace`
- Meaning:
  this is the intended browser workflow-evidence step for aerospace.
- Current local blocker:
  on this Windows host, Playwright Chromium launch fails before app assertions with `spawn EPERM`.
  The runner classifies that condition as `windows-playwright-launch-permission`.
- Caveat:
  treat this as a machine-environment blocker, not as an aerospace assertion failure.

## Prepared vs Executed Distinction

Prepared smoke assertions mean:

- the assertion code exists
- the metadata keys and guardrails are named in the smoke runner
- the current tree is ready for a browser-run environment

Prepared smoke assertions do not mean:

- the browser launched successfully
- the app loaded and exported metadata successfully in a browser run
- the aerospace workflow is fully smoke-validated end to end

Executed smoke evidence means:

- Playwright launched Chromium
- the aerospace smoke phase reached the app
- the aerospace assertions actually ran
- the run passed without the current host-level launcher blocker

## Guardrails

- This ledger is workflow-accounting only.
- It does not imply flight intent.
- It does not imply route impact.
- It does not imply operational consequence.
- It does not imply GPS, radio, aircraft, or satellite failure proof.
- It does not imply severity, threat, causation, target exposure, or action recommendation.

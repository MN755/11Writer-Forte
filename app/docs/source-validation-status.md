# Source Validation Status

This report distinguishes `implemented` from `validated` using repo evidence and known planning context.

Purpose:

- prevent over-promotion on the assignment board
- separate code presence from explicit validation evidence
- show which implemented sources are only contract-tested

Scope:

- [source-assignment-board.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-assignment-board.md)
- [source-onboarding-contract.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-onboarding-contract.md)
- repo evidence in `app/server`, `app/client`, and `app/docs`

Important rules:

- Do not mark a source `validated` unless validation evidence is explicit.
- Route presence, tests, hooks, and minimal UI are enough for `implemented`.
- They are not enough by themselves for `validated`.
- Discovered source candidates are not source implementations. Source discovery can create review evidence and source-memory evidence, but it cannot promote a source to `implemented`, `workflow-validated`, or `fully validated`.
- Browser-only, discovery-only, and runtime-only surfaces are not source implementations by themselves and should remain below implementation proof unless the shared onboarding contract is satisfied by a separate stable public machine-readable endpoint.

Source discovery note:

- [source-discovery-platform-plan.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-discovery-platform-plan.md:1) makes 7Po8-style source discovery a core 11Writer platform capability.
- [source-discovery-agent-framework.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-discovery-agent-framework.md:1) defines the bounded discovery-job, candidate-state, and no-hidden-crawler rules for implementation lanes.
- [source-discovery-reputation-governance-packet.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-discovery-reputation-governance-packet.md:1) is the compact policy boundary for candidate states, reputation observations, claim outcomes, and shared source-memory routing.
- This status report should classify discovered sources as candidates or backlog items until implementation and validation evidence exists.
- Repeated discovery, relevance scoring, or source count does not make a source authoritative or workflow-validated.
- Learned source reputation should be based on claim outcomes, correction behavior, source health, corroboration, and static/live source class handling.
- Correctness reputation is different from wave mission relevance; a correct source can be low-fit for a specific wave without being a bad source.
- Current repo-local source-memory evidence is backend/shared-runtime evidence only and does not by itself create implemented, workflow-validated, or fully validated source rows.
- Wonder's OSINT Framework audit artifacts are candidate-routing input only and do not by themselves prove source safety, machine-readability, legality, or assignment readiness.
- Source Discovery `structure-scan`, knowledge-node clustering/backfill, review-claim import/apply, Wave LLM provider/runtime controls, and media/OCR interpretation surfaces are candidate-routing, review, derived-evidence, or runtime-boundary helpers only; they do not create source-validation proof by themselves.

## Validation Levels

- `implemented`
  - the source slice exists in code
- `contract-tested`
  - backend route and contracts are covered by tests
- `workflow-validated`
  - frontend plus export plus smoke or equivalent workflow validation has been explicitly recorded
- `fully validated`
  - contract coverage, frontend usage, export behavior, smoke coverage, and source-health behavior have all been explicitly validated

## Multi-Source Implementation Notes

### `data-ai-rss-starter-bundle`

- Aggregate route:
  - `/api/feeds/data-ai/recent`
- Current board status:
  - backend-first implemented bundle, tracked as an active bounded lane rather than a single promoted source row
- Existing evidence:
  - `app/server/tests/test_data_ai_multi_feed.py`
  - `app/server/tests/test_rss_feed_service.py`
  - `app/server/src/services/data_ai_feed_registry.py`
  - `app/server/src/services/data_ai_multi_feed_service.py`
  - fixtures for `cisa-cybersecurity-advisories`, `cisa-ics-advisories`, `sans-isc-diary`, `cloudflare-status`, and `gdacs-alerts`
  - prompt-injection-like fixture coverage for free-form feed text
- Full validation status:
  - `implemented-not-fully-validated`
- Blockers / caveats:
  - the bundle is contract-tested and parser-hardened, but no explicit workflow validation or stable frontend consumer record is recorded
  - mixed authority classes remain explicit and must not be collapsed into one severity or truth model
  - feed titles, summaries, descriptions, advisory text, and linked snippets remain untrusted data
- Next validation action:
  - validate one bounded consumer or export path for the aggregate route before treating the starter bundle as anything stronger than implemented

### `data-ai-rss-official-cyber-wave`

- Aggregate route:
  - `/api/feeds/data-ai/recent`

  - Atlas AI progress records shared source-memory storage, claim-outcome updates, wave-fit separation, Wave Monitor source-candidate seeding, bounded seed/health/expand/snapshot/reversal/tick primitives, review queue/actions, runtime-status posture, and a newer Source Discovery Ten-Step backend slice as peer/runtime input
  - Connect AI progress records persistent store wiring and explicit runtime-boundary validation
- Wonder planning docs for Browser Use, macOS plugin workflows, connector capability mapping, and connector adoption remain peer planning input only and do not change source-validation posture
- Wonder archive-index scan, mailing-list archive adapters, and curated directory or regional-portal scan remain candidate/review/runtime discovery input only and do not change source-validation posture
- Full validation status:
  - `implemented-not-fully-validated`
- Blockers / caveats:
  - this is a candidate/reputation/review surface and must not be mistaken for source implementation proof or external-source validation proof
  - Connect progress now explicitly validates provider/runtime boundary posture: config presence is exposed by key-source name only, `fixture` remains deterministic and review-only, and `openai`, `OpenRouter`, `Anthropic`, `xAI`, `Google`, `OpenClaw`, and `ollama` remain gated by provider configuration, explicit network permission, and positive request budget
  - mock-model paths remain deterministic and no provider path is allowed to promote sources, validate claims, activate connectors, or create direct action guidance
  - source reputation observations are not claim truth, source truth, attribution proof, causation proof, intent proof, wrongdoing proof, or action guidance
  - bounded jobs, snapshots, review actions, runtime status, and manual scheduler tick now exist, but no autonomous discovery runner, hidden live polling, or automatic source approval is recorded in current repo evidence
  - `runtime_scheduler_service.py` is currently compatibility and status plumbing, not proof of hidden background scheduling
  - Atlas media geolocation hardening remains peer and derived-evidence input only, not validation proof
  - Wonder Statuspage and Mastodon discovery remain candidate/review discovery input only, not source approval or workflow-validation proof
  - Wonder Stack Exchange and seed-packet discovery remain candidate/review discovery input only, not source approval, implementation proof, or workflow-validation proof
- Next validation action:
  - keep the surface at implemented shared-tool status now that Connect has recorded the runtime/storage boundary truth, and only add later review-workflow validation without bypassing the normal source lifecycle

### `atlas-runtime-operator-console-slice`

- Aggregate status:
  - peer/runtime input pending Connect validation
- Current board status:
  - not a promoted source row and not implemented-proof for Gather status purposes
- Existing evidence:
  - `app/docs/alerts.md`
  - current Gather/Connect next-task docs route the newer Atlas operator-console slice into Connect validation and Gather governance reconciliation
- Full validation status:
  - `unknown`
- Blockers / caveats:
  - Atlas remains user-directed peer input and is not Manager-controlled ownership proof
  - until Connect records current repo-local validation, the operator-console slice must remain runtime-boundary planning input only
  - it must not be treated as source truth, workflow-validation proof, hidden scheduler proof, or runtime approval to widen source status
- Next validation action:
  - wait for explicit Connect validation evidence before treating the slice as anything stronger than peer/runtime input

  - `app/docs/webcam-global-camera-candidate-batch-2026-05.md`
- Full validation status:
  - `implemented-not-fully-validated`
- Blockers / caveats:
  - this is backend-only source-ops evidence over `candidate-sandbox-importable` sources and must not be treated as activation, scheduling, validation, or live-ingest proof
  - current Features/Webcam progress keeps `baton-rouge-traffic-cameras` and `vancouver-web-cam-url-links` at `candidate-sandbox-importable`, `arlington-traffic-cameras` at `endpoint-verified` only, and `qldtraffic-web-cameras` held after a `401` on `/v1/webcams`
  - hostile or prompt-like fixture text remains inert and excluded from compact summary/export outputs
  - no explicit end-to-end workflow-validation record is recorded yet
- Next validation action:
  - keep the summary bounded to candidate review burden and source-health expectation, or add one equally bounded endpoint-verified non-sandbox summary without changing lifecycle meaning

## Summary

### Sources clearly validated

No source was promoted to `validated` or `fully validated` in this report.

Reason:

- Marine workflow evidence is now explicit enough to justify `workflow-validated` for the marine sources below.
- That evidence is still weaker than `validated` or `fully validated`, so those higher promotions are still intentionally withheld.

### Sources promoted to workflow-validated

- `noaa-coops-tides-currents`
- `noaa-ndbc-realtime`
- `scottish-water-overflows`

Evidence basis:

- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_marine_contracts.py -q`
- `python -m compileall app/server/src`
- `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`
- `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`
- `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py marine`
- explicit workflow/export coverage recorded in [marine-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/marine-workflow-validation.md:1)
- marine contract hardening now explicitly covers empty, disabled, caveat, evidence-basis, request-validation behavior, and timestamp-backed `stale` semantics
- marine backend evidence now also records honest `unavailable` handling across the active context families and honest `degraded` handling only where partial-metadata evidence exists

### Sources implemented but blocked by repo-wide issues

None were explicitly blocked by a repo-wide issue in the evidence reviewed for this report.

Aerospace note:

- AWC, FAA NAS, CNEOS, SWPC, and OpenSky are not repo-build blocked in the current evidence.
- Their remaining workflow gap on this host is executed browser smoke, currently blocked by the host-level Playwright launcher classification `windows-browser-launch-permission`, not by frontend compile failure.

If repo-wide lint or build failures unrelated to a source are later reported, the board should keep the source at `in-progress` or `implemented-not-fully-validated` with a blocker note instead of downgrading it to `needs-verification`.

Recommended workflow-level follow-on:

- record one explicit successful end-to-end validation note per implemented source before promoting any of them from `implemented` to `validated`

## Board Correction Notes

No mandatory correction to [source-assignment-board.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-assignment-board.md:1) is required from this report.

Recommended caution:

- keep the board statuses at `implemented`, not `validated`
- marine sources with explicit smoke/export evidence can be promoted to `workflow-validated`, but not beyond that
- documented validation commands in the briefs and prompt index have now been aligned to the actual current repo test filenames

# Atlas AI Progress

## 2026-05-06 05:33 America/Chicago

Task:
- complete media-geolocation tracker item `5`: add GeoCLIP performance controls, profiling, and safe runtime/device controls without silently changing the current accuracy posture

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added explicit GeoCLIP runtime-control settings for:
  - runtime profile
  - target device
  - experimental non-CPU acceleration gating
  - max image edge override
  - prediction-cache entry count
- kept the default runtime posture conservative and explicit:
  - `full_fidelity`
  - `cpu`
  - no silent acceleration
- added fail-closed device resolution so `cuda` or `mps` requests do not silently fall back to a different path when experimental acceleration is not explicitly enabled
- added GeoCLIP performance instrumentation into engine-attempt metadata:
  - `preprocessMs`
  - `predictMs`
  - cache-hit state
  - requested vs resolved device
  - profile metadata
- added two cache-reuse paths:
  - profile-keyed preprocessed artifact reuse on disk
  - exact artifact-and-profile prediction reuse inside the local process
- updated the live benchmark aggregation so per-engine results can expose profiling metrics and cache-hit behavior instead of only coarse end-to-end latency
- reran the real local GeoCLIP and StreetCLIP benchmark with explicit workspace-local model/cache configuration to verify the new profiling path on the actual model stack

- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_source_discovery_memory.py -q`
- enabled live benchmark rerun via:
  - `app/server/.venv-win/Scripts/python.exe app/server/tests/run_media_geolocation_live_benchmark.py`
  - with workspace-local `APP_USER_DATA_DIR`
  - and explicit GeoCLIP / StreetCLIP env overrides pointing at local prepared caches

Key runtime results:
- enabled live benchmark retained the prior accuracy shape on the 11-case curated set:
  - `GeoCLIP top1HitRate25Km: 0.8182`
  - `GeoCLIP top5HitRate25Km: 1.0`
  - `GeoCLIP countryRegionAccuracy: 1.0`
  - `StreetCLIP countryRegionAccuracy: 0.9091`
  - `fusion top1HitRate25Km: 0.8182`
  - `fusion top5HitRate25Km: 1.0`
  - `fusion countryRegionAccuracy: 1.0`
- default CPU `full_fidelity` GeoCLIP remains expensive, with the enabled rerun showing roughly `11` to `12` seconds of mean profiled prediction time
- same-process fusion runs now show GeoCLIP cache-hit behavior when a standalone GeoCLIP pass already computed the same artifact/profile fingerprint earlier in the benchmark

Blockers or caveats:
- the default profile still preserves accuracy posture over speed, so the new controls make tradeoffs explicit but do not magically remove CPU cost
- the preprocessed-artifact reuse path only helps when the selected profile actually requests bounded resizing
- non-CPU GeoCLIP remains explicitly experimental and fail-closed by default in this repo path

Next recommended task:
- start a new post-tracker queue for either:
  - explicit `balanced` / `cpu_optimized` benchmark comparison runs
  - stronger deterministic clue enrichment for the two remaining harder miss classes
  - or operator-surface exposure of the new GeoCLIP runtime controls

## 2026-05-06 00:10 America/Chicago

Task:
- complete media-geolocation tracker items `3` and `4`: strengthen deterministic clue extraction and add explicit GeoCLIP/StreetCLIP install-health tooling

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- strengthened deterministic media-geolocation clue extraction by:
  - normalizing OCR/caption text with geolocation-specific cleanup before parsing
  - adding stronger route-reference extraction such as `US 101` / `I-80`
  - adding explicit left-driving / right-driving text clues
  - adding bounded offline gazetteer landmark/place matches as deterministic place-text clues
  - expanding terrain and infrastructure phrase coverage for coast, bay, canyon, dam, cliffs, and crossings
  - feeding text-derived environment context into the deterministic clue packet
- added explicit GeoCLIP / StreetCLIP install-health tooling in the backend:
  - `GET /api/source-discovery/media/geolocation/models`
  - `POST /api/source-discovery/media/geolocation/models/{model_name}/actions`
- added explicit verify/prewarm workflow support with:
  - ready vs not-ready reporting
  - warm vs cold state
  - present vs missing component lists
  - expected vs installed version visibility
  - GeoCLIP weights and CLIP-backbone snapshot checks
  - StreetCLIP local snapshot checks
- fixed a snapshot-readiness bug so Hugging Face-style model directories are only marked ready when config plus actual weight files are present
- added focused service and route tests covering deterministic clue extraction and media-geolocation model health surfaces

- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_source_discovery_memory.py -q`

Blockers or caveats:
- deterministic clue extraction is stronger, but it is still bounded and should not be treated as authoritative reverse geocoding
- model-health surfaces report local readiness and explicit prewarm state; they do not silently install or download assets
- GeoCLIP performance-control work is still pending and remains the next tracker item

Next recommended task:
- do item `5` from `app/docs/media-geolocation-next-5-tracker.md`: add GeoCLIP performance controls and profiling so local accuracy work can continue without turning CPU-heavy runtime behavior into guesswork

## 2026-05-05 23:46 America/Chicago

Task:
- implement the next media-geolocation items: expand the live benchmark beyond landmarks, add offline GeoCLIP coordinate-to-place enrichment, and create a tracker doc for the five-item follow-on backlog

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- expanded the live media-geolocation benchmark manifest from the original landmark-only set into an 11-case mix spanning:
  - `urban_landmark`
  - `natural_landscape`
  - `transport_infrastructure`
  - `dense_street_scene`
- updated the live benchmark harness to emit `categoryMetrics` and top-level `categoryCounts` instead of only per-engine global aggregates
- added a bounded offline media-geolocation place gazetteer and new settings so GeoCLIP coordinate candidates can be labeled with nearby landmark/locality/admin/country context without external reverse geocoding
- wired the offline place context into:
  - GeoCLIP candidate labels and metadata
  - geolocation summary strings
  - engine-agreement logic
  - country/region benchmark matching
- added focused tests for category-aware aggregation and GeoCLIP place enrichment
- created a dedicated tracker doc for the current five-item media-geolocation follow-on queue
- reran the real local GeoCLIP and StreetCLIP benchmark against the expanded manifest

- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_source_discovery_memory.py -q`
- full live benchmark via `app/server/.venv-win/Scripts/python.exe app/server/tests/run_media_geolocation_live_benchmark.py`

Key runtime results:
- live benchmark size:
  - `11` cases
  - `4` categories
- `GeoCLIP`
  - `top1HitRate25Km: 0.8182`
  - `top5HitRate25Km: 1.0`
  - `countryRegionAccuracy: 1.0`
- `fusion`
  - `top1HitRate25Km: 0.8182`
  - `top5HitRate25Km: 1.0`
  - `countryRegionAccuracy: 1.0`
- `StreetCLIP`
  - `countryRegionAccuracy: 0.9091`

Blockers or caveats:
- the offline gazetteer is intentionally bounded and should grow carefully; it is a local humanization layer, not authoritative reverse geocoding
- the hardest current misses remain `Bixby Creek Bridge` and `Mount Fuji from Lake Kawaguchi`, which means natural/infrastructure scenes still need stronger deterministic clue extraction and/or better secondary ranking
- GeoCLIP remains CPU-expensive in the local path even after the benchmark/reporting cleanup
- `git diff --check` reported only LF/CRLF warnings for touched files

Next recommended task:
- do item `3` from `app/docs/media-geolocation-next-5-tracker.md`: strengthen deterministic clue extraction for harder outdoor scenes before moving to heavier install/health or performance-control work

## 2026-05-05 22:22 America/Chicago

Task:
- resume live media-geolocation model integration, fix GeoCLIP runtime blockers, and run the curated local benchmark

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added managed local snapshot handling for the GeoCLIP CLIP backbone and StreetCLIP model so both engines use explicit workspace-managed/runtime-managed paths instead of implicit Hugging Face user-profile cache behavior
- added GeoCLIP compatibility patching for the installed `transformers` `5.8.0` return shape so the third-party package still produces image embeddings correctly
- fixed media fetch behavior so oversized public media are rejected instead of being silently truncated into corrupted artifacts
- updated the live benchmark harness to use the configured media byte budget instead of a hardcoded `3_000_000` byte cap
- tuned fusion scoring so coordinate-bearing GeoCLIP candidates outrank StreetCLIP label-only candidates while StreetCLIP remains supporting coarse-label evidence
- ran the curated landmark benchmark successfully with live local GeoCLIP and StreetCLIP execution
- updated the media geolocation framework doc with the live benchmark posture and current engine findings

Files touched:
- `app/docs/agent-progress/atlas-ai.md`
- `app/docs/alerts.md`
- `app/docs/media-geolocation-framework.md`
- `app/server/src/config/settings.py`
- `app/server/src/services/media_evidence_service.py`
- `app/server/src/services/media_geolocation_eval_service.py`

Validation:
- `python -m py_compile app/server/src/services/media_evidence_service.py app/server/src/config/settings.py app/server/src/services/media_geolocation_eval_service.py`
- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_media_geolocation_eval.py -q`
- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_source_discovery_memory.py -q`
- live GeoCLIP single-case probe on Golden Gate Bridge via `app/server/.venv-win`
- live StreetCLIP single-case probe on Golden Gate Bridge via `app/server/.venv-win`
- full curated live benchmark via `python app/server/tests/run_media_geolocation_live_benchmark.py`

Blockers or caveats:
- the current live benchmark set is small and landmark-heavy; it is useful for tuning but not broad real-world proof
- GeoCLIP is accurate on the current benchmark but slow on local CPU, roughly `9` to `13` seconds per image in this environment
- StreetCLIP is strong for supplied coarse labels but still does not emit coordinates, so it should stay a reranker/support engine
- local model caches and the benchmark report live under runtime artifacts, not commit material:
  - `app/server/data/model-cache/`
  - `app/server/data/runtime-user/`

Next recommended task:
- expand the curated benchmark with harder non-landmark outdoor scenes, then add bounded place-label enrichment for GeoCLIP coordinate candidates so country/region reporting is less dependent on StreetCLIP-only labels

## 2026-05-01 14:51 America/Chicago

Task:
- continue 7Po8 integration by wiring Wave Monitor into shared 11Writer analyst/system surfaces

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added a fresh Manager-facing alert because this touched shared backend/docs surfaces and another AI's coordination area had already completed the prior alert
- integrated Wave Monitor signals into `GET /api/analyst/evidence-timeline` as `tool-wave-monitor` items behind `include_wave_monitor`
- integrated Wave Monitor readiness into `GET /api/analyst/source-readiness` as a `tool-wave-monitor` card
- updated Analyst Workbench docs and the 7Po8 integration plan to describe the shared-system integration
- updated Analyst Workbench tests to cover Wave Monitor timeline/readiness behavior and disable it explicitly when testing environmental-only output

- stale artifact scan under `7Po8` for `__pycache__`, `*.pyc`, `*.db`, `*.sqlite3`, and `*.tsbuildinfo`

Blockers or caveats:
- this is still fixture-backed integration; persistent Wave Monitor storage, live connectors, backend-only scheduling, and frontend Situation Workspace UI remain unimplemented
- `git diff --check` reported only line-ending warnings for touched docs

Next recommended task:
- build the frontend Situation Workspace/Analyst consumer for `tool-wave-monitor`, or port persistent Wave Monitor storage using 11Writer runtime user-data paths

## 2026-05-01 13:47 America/Chicago

Task:
- notify Manager AI and begin 7Po8 cleanup/integration as a 11Writer-native Wave Monitor tool

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- updated the Manager-facing alert with the active 7Po8 Wave Monitor integration status
- added the first fixture-backed 11Writer-native Wave Monitor backend surface at `GET /api/tools/waves/overview`
- added Wave Monitor response contracts, service logic, route wiring, and focused tests
- kept the imported 7Po8 standalone runtime unmounted while exposing 7Po8 concepts through 11Writer contracts
- updated the 7Po8 integration plan with the current implemented slice

- stale artifact scan under `7Po8` for `__pycache__`, `*.pyc`, `*.db`, `*.sqlite3`, and `*.tsbuildinfo`

Blockers or caveats:
- this is a fixture-backed contract/tool surface only; no persistent Wave Monitor database, live connector execution, scheduler, or frontend workspace panel was implemented
- `git diff --check` reported only line-ending warnings for touched files

Next recommended task:
- build the Situation Workspace consumer for Wave Monitor cards, or port the first persistent Wave Monitor storage/contracts slice using 11Writer runtime user-data paths

## 2026-05-01 13:39 America/Chicago

Task:
- assess imported 7Po8 project, remove stale runtime artifacts, and plan integration as a 11Writer tool

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- inspected 7Po8 backend/frontend/docs structure and identified useful concepts: waves, connectors, records, signals, source discovery, source checks, domain trust, policy actions, and scheduler ticks
- removed generated/runtime artifacts from the imported 7Po8 tree: frontend `node_modules`, `dist`, TypeScript build-info, generated Vite JS/DTS config, backend caches, egg-info, bytecode, and local SQLite runtime/smoke databases
- added a 7Po8 integration plan that treats the project as a Wave Monitor tool inside 11Writer's shared runtime and Situation Workspace instead of a separate app/runtime
- linked the plan from unified workflows and source prompt index docs

Files touched:
- `7Po8/`

- `app/docs/unified-user-workflows.md`
- `app/docs/source-prompt-index.md`

- `git diff --check -- app/docs/7po8-integration-plan.md app/docs/unified-user-workflows.md app/docs/source-prompt-index.md app/docs/agent-progress/atlas-ai.md`

Blockers or caveats:
- no 7Po8 backend pytest or frontend npm tests were run because this pass intentionally removed local runtime dependencies/artifacts and did not install dependencies
- 7Po8 remains an imported reference project until code is ported into 11Writer-native backend/frontend modules

Next recommended task:
- implement Slice 1 from the integration plan: define 11Writer-native Wave Monitor contracts for Wave/Monitor, Connector, Record, Signal, RunHistory, DiscoveredSource, SourceCheck, and DomainTrust with source health, evidence basis, caveats, and export metadata

## 2026-05-01 13:06 America/Chicago

Task:
- notify Manager AI and define a safe cross-source hypothesis workflow for connecting seemingly unrelated signals

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added a Manager-facing alert that Atlas is documenting a cross-source hypothesis graph workflow
- added a hypothesis graph planning doc for surfacing possible relationships across cyber, scam, investigation, regional news, public event, entity, location, and source-health signals
- linked hypothesis workflow guidance into the unified user workflow, fusion layer architecture, and source prompt index docs
- defined safety boundaries, evidence ladder, hypothesis states, relationship types, confidence tiers, export rules, and implementation slices

- reference scan for `cross-source-hypothesis-graph`, `HypothesisGraph`, and `Hypothesis`

Blockers or caveats:
- docs/design only; no backend or frontend implementation was performed
- `git diff --check` reported only line-ending warnings for touched docs

Next recommended task:
- implement a bounded first slice: relationship reasons on existing Data AI/Analyst Workbench clusters, with confidence ceilings, caveats, contradiction fixtures, and an inspector display for why records were grouped

## 2026-05-01 12:53 America/Chicago

Task:
- define unified user workflows across the product without creating separate domain workflow pages

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added a unified workflow planning doc centered on one `Situation Workspace` and the flow `User sees information -> user wants more information -> user can decide or move on`
- covered the main product domains in the shared workflow model: Now view, Data AI/RSS/cyber/news, environmental/geospatial, marine, aerospace, webcams/source operations, imagery/base layers, reference/entity linking, source health/validation, tasks/monitors/backend-only, companion web, and desktop
- linked the unified workflow doc from roadmap, strategic roadmap, UI integration, and source prompt index docs so future agents use it as the main workflow target

Files touched:

- link reference scan for `unified-user-workflows`

Blockers or caveats:
- docs/design only; no backend or frontend implementation was performed
- `git diff --check` reported only line-ending warnings for touched docs

Next recommended task:
- assign a large implementation slice for the shared Situation Workspace: unified attention cards, universal inspector detail drawer, and queue/review state across source health, Data AI leads, environmental events, marine anomalies, aerospace context, and webcam operations

## 2026-05-01 12:46 America/Chicago

Task:
- define user workflows for Data AI RSS/feed tools and confirm Manager AI notification state

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- confirmed the Manager-facing Atlas alert about expanded Data AI RSS resources is present and open
- added a Data AI user workflow design doc describing how feeds become leads, event clusters, source-health cards, drilldowns, monitors, map/timeline context, and exportable analyst work products

- link reference scan for `data-ai-user-workflows`

Blockers or caveats:
- docs/design only; no backend or frontend implementation was performed
- `git diff --check` reported only existing line-ending warnings for touched docs

Next recommended task:
- assign a bounded implementation slice for the Analyst Workbench feed workflow: normalized leads, source-health cards, initial cluster candidates, lead detail drawer, and daily brief endpoint

## 2026-05-01 12:37 America/Chicago

Task:
- notify Manager AI about Atlas source expansion work and assess current project deficiencies and velocity

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added a Manager-facing alert that Atlas validated 110 additional Batch 3 Data AI RSS/Atom/RDF feeds and that the Data AI validated feed candidate total is now 277
- reviewed coordination, release-readiness, validation, source assignment, next-task, and active agent progress docs to assess current project state
- identified current high-level deficiencies around cross-platform implementation, workflow validation depth, source ingestion scale, UI integration, backend-only runtime readiness, and dirty-worktree consolidation risk

Files touched:
- `app/docs/alerts.md`
- `app/docs/agent-progress/atlas-ai.md`

Validation:
- docs/status review only; no test suite was run in this pass

Blockers or caveats:
- assessment is based on current repo docs, active-task state, validation-status docs, and worktree status rather than a fresh full validation run
- no staging, commit, or push was performed

Next recommended task:
- prioritize big-platform work: common analyst workbench/source-health surface, runtime mode foundation, Data AI ingestion platform, and workflow-validation promotion tooling

## 2026-04-30 22:11 America/Chicago

Task:
- find and validate 100 more RSS feeds for Data AI with broader global coverage beyond news

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- validated 110 additional RSS/Atom/RDF feeds for Data AI Batch 3
- added trusted and important global-coverage sources including Bellingcat, Citizen Lab, EFF, Access Now, Privacy International, Freedom House, DFRLab, Full Fact, Snopes, PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, EUvsDisinfo, OCCRP, ICIJ, ProPublica, Lighthouse Reports, CPJ, Atlantic Council, ECFR, FDD, War on the Rocks, Oxfam, Our World in Data, Carbon Brief, Mongabay, Smithsonian volcano updates, U.S. travel advisories, UN press releases, OpenStreetMap, and more
- linked Batch 3 from the main Data AI RSS doc, source prompt index, assignment board, data-source registry, and consolidated source registry
- updated Data AI validated feed counts from 167 to 277 total
- updated the combined approved/feed candidate total to 425

- `app/docs/data-source-registry.md`
- `app/docs/source-consolidated-noauth-registry.md`
- `app/docs/agent-progress/atlas-ai.md`

Validation:
- validated candidate URLs with normal backend-style HTTP requests and XML parsing as RSS, Atom, or RDF
- accepted 110 feeds with HTTP 200, parseable XML, and non-empty item/entry counts
- `rg` scan for Batch 3 doc links/counts/source IDs
- `git diff --check` on touched docs

Blockers or caveats:
- no implementation was performed
- Batch 3 contains many high-context media, NGO, think-tank, investigative, and regional feeds; these must stay contextual unless the source is authoritative for the specific record
- same-publisher and same-region feeds can duplicate stories and require GUID/link/hash dedupe

Next recommended task:
- after Data AI's core parser lands, onboard Batch 3 by category, starting with OSINT/investigations and official/travel/security feeds before broad regional media feeds

## 2026-04-30 17:08 America/Chicago

Task:
- find and validate 100 more RSS feeds for Data AI

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- validated 115 additional RSS/Atom/RDF feeds beyond the first Data AI RSS list
- added a Batch 2 Data AI RSS source candidate document
- linked Batch 2 from the main Data AI RSS doc, source prompt index, assignment board, data-source registry, and consolidated registry
- updated Data AI validated feed counts from 52 to 167 total
- updated the combined approved/feed candidate total to 315

Files touched:
- `app/docs/data-ai-rss-source-candidates-batch2.md`
- `app/docs/data-ai-rss-source-candidates.md`
- `app/docs/source-prompt-index.md`
- `app/docs/source-assignment-board.md`
- `app/docs/data-source-registry.md`
- `app/docs/source-consolidated-noauth-registry.md`
- `app/docs/agent-progress/atlas-ai.md`

Validation:
- validated 148 candidate URLs with normal backend-style HTTP requests and XML parsing as RSS, Atom, or RDF
- accepted 115 feeds with HTTP 200, parseable XML, and non-empty item/entry counts
- `rg` scan for Batch 2 doc links/counts/source IDs
- `git diff --check` on touched docs

Blockers or caveats:
- no implementation was performed
- Data AI should not poll all 167 feeds until the generic parser, source-health, dedupe, and backoff model exist
- same-publisher section feeds can duplicate stories and require GUID/link/hash dedupe

Next recommended task:
- keep Data AI's first implementation slice small; after the parser is stable, add Batch 2 feeds by source family rather than all at once

## 2026-04-30 16:51 America/Chicago

Task:
- notify Manager AI about new sources and find RSS/Atom sources for the new Data AI lane

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added a Manager-facing alert that 52 Data AI RSS/Atom/RDF feeds are validated and ready for routing
- added a dedicated Data AI RSS source candidate doc covering cybersecurity, internet infrastructure, world events, world health/science, and world news
- documented the recommended first 20 feeds and a safer first implementation slice of 5 feeds
- updated source prompt, assignment-board, data-source registry, and consolidated source registry docs with Data AI RSS routing and guardrails
- updated the consolidated approved/backlog candidate count to 200, including the 52 Data AI feeds

Files touched:
- `app/docs/alerts.md`
- `app/docs/data-ai-rss-source-candidates.md`
- `app/docs/source-prompt-index.md`
- `app/docs/source-assignment-board.md`
- `app/docs/data-source-registry.md`
- `app/docs/source-consolidated-noauth-registry.md`
- `app/docs/agent-progress/atlas-ai.md`

Validation:
- validated candidate feeds with normal backend-style HTTP requests and XML parsing as RSS, Atom, or RDF
- found 52 working feeds with HTTP 200 and non-empty item/entry counts
- recorded held/excluded feeds that failed validation or were discontinued

Blockers or caveats:
- no implementation was performed
- Data AI should not start by polling all 52 feeds; build a generic fixture-first parser and source-health model first
- media, vendor, and blog feeds must remain contextual awareness and not official confirmation

Next recommended task:
- assign Data AI a first parser slice using `cisa-cybersecurity-advisories`, `cisa-ics-advisories`, `sans-isc-diary`, `cloudflare-status`, and `gdacs-alerts`

## 2026-04-30 16:38 America/Chicago

Task:
- verify geography/base-earth no-auth source candidates and add them to the source list

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added Batch 7 base-earth source briefs covering bathymetry, global relief, shorelines, physical cartography, glaciers, hydrography, wetlands, soils, land cover, tectonic boundaries, and volcano references
- added 20 source ids to the machine-readable no-auth registry with verification status, first-slice guidance, caveats, and do-not-do rules
- promoted 18 sources as approved/backlog candidates and held 2 as `needs-verification`
- updated the consolidated registry count from 130 to 148 approved/backlog candidates
- updated source assignment and prompt-routing docs so future agents can pick narrow first slices safely

Files touched:
- `app/docs/source-acceleration-phase2-batch7-base-earth-briefs.md`
- `app/docs/data_sources.noauth.registry.json`
- `app/docs/source-consolidated-noauth-registry.md`

- `app/docs/source-prompt-index.md`
- `app/docs/source-assignment-board.md`
- `app/docs/agent-progress/atlas-ai.md`

Validation:
- verified candidate source posture against public provider documentation and public data/service pages
- `python -m json.tool app/docs/data_sources.noauth.registry.json`
- `rg` scan for Batch 7 ids across registry/routing docs
- `git diff --check` on touched source docs

Blockers or caveats:
- `allen-coral-atlas-reefs` remains `needs-verification` because public product descriptions are verified, but normal Atlas downloads appear account-oriented and Earth Engine requires registration
- `usgs-tectonic-boundaries-reference` remains `needs-verification` because public-domain USGS maps are verified, but a stable global machine-readable GIS route was not pinned
- no implementation was performed

Next recommended task:
- have Gather AI or Manager AI route one Batch 7 assignment-ready source at a time, starting with `natural-earth-physical`, `gshhg-shorelines`, `noaa-global-volcano-locations`, `pb2002-plate-boundaries`, or `rgi-glacier-inventory`

## 2026-04-30 16:27 America/Chicago

Task:
- scan documentation for stale platform wording and align platform references to the cross-platform operating plan

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- updated the root README to describe the three first-class interfaces and clarify that current commands are the local development foundation, not final packaged behavior
- updated architecture docs so the browser/API split is framed as the foundation for full desktop, companion web, and backend-only runtime surfaces
- updated the strategic roadmap so source rejection language does not conflict with the approved companion web app direction
- updated validation guidance so Windows-local validation is clearly not proof of cross-platform support
- updated webcam docs so current local worker behavior points toward the shared backend-only runtime/task model for future long-running collection

Files touched:
- `README.md`
- `app/docs/architecture.md`
- `app/docs/strategic-roadmap.md`
- `app/docs/validation-matrix.md`
- `app/docs/webcams.md`
- `app/docs/agent-progress/atlas-ai.md`

Validation:
- `rg` scan for stale platform phrases across `README.md` and `app/docs`
- docs diff review

Blockers or caveats:
- no code, packaging, runtime binding, companion pairing/auth, or OS-native validation was changed in this pass

Next recommended task:
- have Manager AI and active agents use `app/docs/cross-platform-agent-broadcast.md` as the standing platform requirement in future assignments

## 2026-04-30 16:23 America/Chicago

Task:
- notify Manager AI and all agents that the cross-platform plan is now the core platform operating plan

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- appended a high-priority shared alert for Manager AI to broadcast the cross-platform operating plan to all active agents
- named Connect AI, Gather AI, Geospatial AI, Aerospace AI, Marine AI, Features/Webcam AI, and Manager AI in the alert description
- pointed agents to `app/docs/cross-platform-agent-broadcast.md` before future assignments

Files touched:
- `app/docs/alerts.md`
- `app/docs/agent-progress/atlas-ai.md`

Validation:
- docs diff review only

Blockers or caveats:
- Manager AI still needs to update future prompts or next-task docs for each affected agent using the broadcast block

Next recommended task:
- have Manager AI perform a check-in/broadcast pass so every active lane receives the cross-platform requirements

## 2026-04-30 16:16 America/Chicago

Task:
- create detailed cross-platform implementation docs and agent guidelines for future development

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added a detailed implementation playbook for accomplishing the three-interface cross-platform goal phase by phase
- added agent development guidelines covering shared backend/core rules, runtime modes, path/storage rules, desktop behavior, companion web behavior, backend-only behavior, pairing/auth, packaging, testing, documentation, ownership, red flags, and final-report requirements
- added a reusable cross-platform broadcast block for Manager AI to paste into future agent prompts or next-task docs
- linked the new docs from the existing cross-platform plan, runtime requirements, and repo workflow standing updates

Files touched:
- `app/docs/cross-platform-implementation-playbook.md`
- `app/docs/cross-platform-agent-guidelines.md`
- `app/docs/cross-platform-agent-broadcast.md`
- `app/docs/cross-platform-desktop-app-plan.md`
- `app/docs/runtime-interface-requirements.md`
- `app/docs/repo-workflow.md`
- `app/docs/agent-progress/atlas-ai.md`

Validation:
- docs diff review only

Blockers or caveats:
- no implementation was performed
- other agents still need their next-task docs or prompts updated with the broadcast block before cross-platform requirements are considered absorbed

Next recommended task:
- notify Manager AI and the other agents using `app/docs/cross-platform-agent-broadcast.md`, then begin Phase 1 runtime foundation work when the user is ready

## 2026-04-30 16:10 America/Chicago

Task:
- create runtime interface requirements for the three-interface 11Writer architecture

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added a requirements document for the full desktop app, companion web app, and backend-only runtime
- pinned runtime modes, lifecycle expectations, resource/user-data path rules, pairing/auth requirements, task runtime requirements, service/daemon requirements, shared API requirements, security rules, storage rules, build expectations, validation gates, and implementation order
- kept the requirements aligned with the existing cross-platform app/runtime plan

Files touched:
- `app/docs/runtime-interface-requirements.md`
- `app/docs/agent-progress/atlas-ai.md`

Validation:
- docs diff review only

Blockers or caveats:
- no implementation was performed
- companion access remains blocked behind future pairing/auth implementation before any backend may listen beyond loopback

Next recommended task:
- start Phase 1 implementation by adding runtime path/config helpers and an explicit backend runtime launcher with `dev`, `desktop-sidecar`, `backend-only`, and `companion-server` modes

## 2026-04-30 16:05 America/Chicago

Task:
- update the cross-platform plan to reflect three first-class interfaces: full app, companion web app, and backend-only runtime

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- revised the desktop-only plan into a broader cross-platform app and runtime architecture
- documented the full desktop app, companion web app, and backend-only runtime as separate product interfaces backed by one shared FastAPI/core runtime
- added companion web requirements for trusted partner-device access, pairing/auth, short-session mobile/check-in workflows, and lighter UI surfaces
- added backend-only requirements for long-running tasks, 24/7 collection, service/daemon lifecycle, persisted task state, source health, and UI attach/inspect workflows
- expanded required code changes, validation, platform risks, implementation phases, and first concrete tasks around the three-interface model

Files touched:
- `app/docs/cross-platform-desktop-app-plan.md`
- `app/docs/agent-progress/atlas-ai.md`

Validation:
- docs diff review only

Blockers or caveats:
- no implementation was performed
- partner-device and internet access require explicit pairing/auth before any backend listens beyond loopback

Next recommended task:
- create `app/docs/runtime-interface-requirements.md` to pin detailed requirements for the three modes before implementation begins

## 2026-04-30 15:45 America/Chicago

Task:
- research and document a game plan for turning 11Writer into a Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop app

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- inspected the current Vite/React/Cesium frontend, FastAPI backend, settings, local SQLite/data paths, and smoke harness assumptions
- researched current official Electron, Electron Forge, Tauri, PyInstaller, and Uvicorn packaging/runtime guidance
- added a cross-platform desktop app plan recommending Electron plus a PyInstaller-packaged FastAPI sidecar as the first path to preserve current functionality
- documented target architecture, required code changes, CI/release plan, validation matrix, platform risks, phases, and concrete first tasks

Files touched:
- `app/docs/cross-platform-desktop-app-plan.md`
- `app/docs/agent-progress/atlas-ai.md`

Validation:
- docs/research task only; no code validation run

Blockers or caveats:
- no implementation was performed
- packaging feasibility still needs OS-native proof on Windows, macOS, and Linux because PyInstaller and desktop installers are not one-host cross-compilation workflows
- Cesium/WebGL must be smoke-tested in the packaged shell before choosing any smaller WebView-based alternative

Next recommended task:
- implement Phase 1 from the plan: a desktop backend launcher plus FastAPI static serving of the built frontend from one loopback origin

## 2026-04-30 15:28 America/Chicago

Task:
- capture the user-provided consolidated no-auth source registry in repo docs

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added a consolidated human-readable no-auth source registry covering the 130 approved/backlog source candidates, special guardrails, rejected source families, and the key distinction that approved does not mean implemented
- linked the consolidated registry from the existing no-auth registry page and source prompt index
- kept implementation/status truth conservative by not changing source implementation state in the assignment board or validation docs

Files touched:
- `app/docs/source-consolidated-noauth-registry.md`
- `app/docs/data-source-registry.md`
- `app/docs/source-prompt-index.md`
- `app/docs/agent-progress/atlas-ai.md`

Validation:
- docs diff review only

Blockers or caveats:
- Batch 6 entries are recorded as approved candidates/backlog items only; no endpoint verification or implementation status promotion was performed in this pass
- Some older repo docs still carry more granular per-source classifications that may intentionally differ from this consolidated approval-candidate list

Next recommended task:
- if requested, reconcile Batch 6 into the assignment board and machine-readable JSON registry with per-source owners, endpoints, statuses, and guardrails

## 2026-04-30 15:10 America/Chicago

Task:
- startup sync for the dedicated Atlas AI lane

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- read the dedicated Atlas AI onboarding, workflow, worktree, alerts, next-task, and progress docs
- recorded that Atlas AI is user-directed, is not part of the Geospatial AI lane, and is ready for direct user instructions
- reconciled the Atlas startup alert state with the shared alert ledger

Files touched:
- `app/docs/agent-progress/atlas-ai.md`
- `app/docs/alerts.md`

Validation:
- docs readback only

Blockers or caveats:
- none

Next recommended task:
- wait for direct user instructions

## 2026-05-01 15:04 America/Chicago

Task:
- implement Phase 2 backend-only Wave Monitor persistence, live connector, and scheduler primitives

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added 11Writer-native Wave Monitor SQLite models and session helpers for monitors, connectors, records, signals, runs, and source candidates
- moved the Wave Monitor overview from fixture-only service state to persistent backend storage configured by `WAVE_MONITOR_DATABASE_URL`
- added bounded `run-now` and manual scheduler tick API behavior for enabled RSS connectors, including fixture and live source modes
- kept Wave Monitor integrated with Analyst Workbench evidence timeline and source-readiness without mounting the standalone 7Po8 runtime
- documented the new backend slice in the 7Po8 integration plan and kept frontend work deferred

Files touched:
- `app/docs/7po8-integration-plan.md`
- `app/docs/agent-progress/atlas-ai.md`
- `app/docs/alerts.md`
- `app/server/src/config/settings.py`

Validation:
- `python -m compileall app/server/src`
- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_wave_monitor.py app/server/tests/test_analyst_workbench.py -q`

Blockers or caveats:
- no frontend work was performed by request
- no hidden background scheduler loop is enabled yet; scheduler execution is manual/API-triggered
- create/update APIs for user-authored monitors and connectors are still needed

Next recommended task:
- add monitor/connector CRUD plus source-check persistence, then register the manual tick with the backend-only runtime task system once that runtime control layer is ready

## 2026-05-01 15:14 America/Chicago

Task:
- make 7Po8-style source discovery an important 11Writer-wide platform capability and notify Manager AI

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added a dedicated Source Discovery Platform plan that promotes source discovery from a Wave Monitor-only concept into a shared 11Writer source-candidate lifecycle capability
- documented candidate lifecycle states, source packet fields, allowed discovery inputs, forbidden discovery behavior, ownership routing, user workflow, and implementation slices
- updated the 7Po8 integration plan so `DiscoveredSource` maps to platform-wide source-candidate packets and future shared source-candidate storage
- updated the unified user workflow so source discovery fits the single workspace pattern
- updated the source prompt index, workflow-validation plan, and validation-status report so all agents treat discovery as candidate evidence only, not implementation or validation proof
- added a Manager-facing alert for the platform priority change

Files touched:
- `app/docs/source-discovery-platform-plan.md`
- `app/docs/7po8-integration-plan.md`
- `app/docs/unified-user-workflows.md`
- `app/docs/source-prompt-index.md`
- `app/docs/source-workflow-validation-plan.md`
- `app/docs/source-validation-status.md`
- `app/docs/alerts.md`
- `app/docs/agent-progress/atlas-ai.md`

Validation:
- docs-only change; no backend or frontend tests required
- `git diff --check -- app/docs/source-discovery-platform-plan.md app/docs/7po8-integration-plan.md app/docs/unified-user-workflows.md app/docs/source-prompt-index.md app/docs/source-workflow-validation-plan.md app/docs/source-validation-status.md app/docs/alerts.md app/docs/agent-progress/atlas-ai.md`

Blockers or caveats:
- no source-discovery backend job runner was implemented in this pass
- autonomous discovery remains a governed candidate-generation workflow, not a hidden crawler, source-truth system, or automatic polling engine

Next recommended task:
- implement the shared backend source-candidate store and packet contract, then migrate Wave Monitor source candidates toward that shared service

## 2026-05-01 15:37 America/Chicago

Task:
- correct source discovery platform requirements to include autonomous source-reputation learning, cross-wave source memory, full-text evidence, and source-class-aware scoring

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- revised the Source Discovery Platform plan so automatic discovery is not only a candidate queue, but a long-running learning system that improves source trust over time
- added explicit global reputation, domain reputation, wave-fit, source-health, and claim-level history concepts
- added cross-wave source memory so waves can reuse verified, degraded, rejected, low-fit, and domain-specific source knowledge from prior waves
- separated correctness from mission relevance so a source can be accurate but low-fit for one wave
- defined different scoring expectations for static sources, live sources, full-text articles, social/image evidence, official sources, and community sources
- added claim outcomes: confirmed, contradicted, corrected, outdated, unresolved, and not-applicable
- updated the Wave Monitor integration plan, unified workflow doc, source prompt index, validation plan, and validation-status report to reflect the learning model
- added a Manager-facing alert for the platform priority change

Files touched:

Blockers or caveats:
- no backend source-reputation service or claim tracker was implemented in this pass
- future implementation needs explicit audit logs for reputation changes so learned trust remains explainable and reversible

Next recommended task:
- implement shared backend tables/contracts for source memory, source reputation, wave fit, claim outcomes, and cross-wave source sharing

## 2026-05-01 15:47 America/Chicago

Task:
- implement the first backend systems for shared source memory, source reputation, claim outcomes, and cross-wave wave-fit sharing

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added shared Source Discovery persistence models for source memories, per-wave fit, claim outcomes, and reputation audit events
- added `SOURCE_DISCOVERY_DATABASE_URL` configuration and a SQLite-backed source discovery session layer
- added source discovery API contracts and routes:
  - `GET /api/source-discovery/memory/overview`
  - `POST /api/source-discovery/memory/candidates`
  - `POST /api/source-discovery/memory/claim-outcomes`
- implemented deterministic reputation updates for confirmed, contradicted, corrected, outdated, unresolved, and not-applicable claim outcomes
- preserved the key separation between correctness reputation and wave-specific mission relevance
- wired Wave Monitor source candidates into shared Source Discovery memory so existing wave candidates can seed cross-wave source memory
- added focused backend tests for source-memory scoring, not-applicable low-fit behavior, and Wave Monitor source-candidate seeding
- updated the Source Discovery and 7Po8 integration docs with current implementation status
- added a Manager-facing alert for the completed backend slice

- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_source_discovery_memory.py app/server/tests/test_wave_monitor.py app/server/tests/test_analyst_workbench.py -q`

Blockers or caveats:
- no autonomous discovery runner, full-text fetcher, social/image evidence fetcher, or frontend review workflow was implemented in this slice
- focused tests pass, but Pydantic emitted existing-style schema warnings during the source-discovery route tests; they did not fail validation

Next recommended task:
- add a bounded discovery job runner that can process explicit seed URLs and allowed feed/catalog links into the shared source memory store without broad crawling

## 2026-05-01 15:56 America/Chicago

Task:
- build more of the Source Discovery platform and define the framework agents should use

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added persistent Source Discovery job audit storage for bounded discovery work
- added a bounded seed-url job primitive that classifies explicit HTTP(S) seed URLs into candidate source memory without polling, broad crawling, or automatic trust promotion
- added rejection behavior for non-HTTP(S) seed URLs so unsafe local/file-style inputs do not create candidates
- exposed `POST /api/source-discovery/jobs/seed-url` for backend agents and added recent job summaries to the memory overview response
- added focused tests for completed and rejected seed-url jobs
- added `app/docs/source-discovery-agent-framework.md` as the required implementation framework for future agents building discovery jobs
- updated the platform plan and source prompt index to point agents at the new framework
- updated the Manager-facing alert with the completed framework/backend slice

Blockers or caveats:
- focused tests pass, but Pydantic still emits existing-style schema alias warnings during source-discovery route tests
- no live fetcher, full-text extraction, source-health scheduler, social/image evidence pipeline, or frontend review workflow was implemented in this slice

Next recommended task:
- implement source-health checks and a bounded feed/catalog expansion job that can safely discover child feeds from already-approved seed sources

## 2026-05-02 09:18 America/Chicago

Task:
- implement the first five Source Discovery backend follow-ups: source health, bounded expansion, full-text storage, reputation reversal, and scheduler integration

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added source-health check storage and `POST /api/source-discovery/health/check`
- added bounded feed/catalog expansion storage behavior and `POST /api/source-discovery/jobs/expand`
- added full-text/content snapshot storage and `POST /api/source-discovery/content/snapshots`
- added reputation-event reversal fields, response contracts, and `POST /api/source-discovery/reputation/reverse-event`
- added scheduler tick storage and `POST /api/source-discovery/scheduler/tick`
- added recent reputation events to source-discovery memory overview so reversal tooling has an API-visible audit path
- added SQLite column backfill for existing `source_reputation_events` tables so local databases created before this slice can support reversal metadata
- updated Source Discovery framework and platform-plan docs with the new backend primitives
- notified Manager AI through `app/docs/alerts.md`

Blockers or caveats:
- focused backend tests pass, but the existing Pydantic schema alias warnings still appear during source-discovery route tests
- scheduler integration is currently an API tick primitive, not a long-running OS/background process
- bounded expansion still creates review candidates only; it does not promote, poll, or trust child sources
- full-text extraction is a conservative first-pass parser, not a mature article readability engine

Next recommended task:
- add canonical URL/domain dedupe, backoff scheduling rules, and source-class/domain-specific scoring helpers on top of the new primitives

## 2026-05-02 09:53 America/Chicago

Task:
- add a babysat per-wave LLM interpretation framework with BYOK provider support

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added Wave LLM runtime settings for BYOK/provider configuration without exposing raw keys
- added provider capability route for `fixture`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `xai`, `google`, `openrouter`, `ollama`, `openclaw`, and `custom`
- added persistent Wave LLM task and review tables
- added `POST /api/tools/waves/llm/tasks` to create bounded per-wave interpretation tasks
- added `POST /api/tools/waves/llm/reviews` to submit model output through deterministic validation
- added validation that accepts candidate claims for review only, rejects malformed/short claims, caps confidence at `0.85`, flags risk conditions, and requires human review
- added `app/docs/wave-llm-interpretation-framework.md` and linked it from the source prompt index and 7Po8 integration plan
- notified Manager AI through `app/docs/alerts.md`

- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_source_discovery_memory.py app/server/tests/test_wave_monitor.py app/server/tests/test_analyst_workbench.py -q`

Blockers or caveats:
- provider adapters do not call live APIs yet; this slice creates the safe contracts, storage, and review gate
- LLM output is deliberately not wired into source reputation, connector activation, or trusted facts
- existing Pydantic schema alias warnings still appear during route tests

Next recommended task:
- add the first provider adapter behind this contract, likely Ollama fixture/live-local first, then OpenAI/OpenRouter BYOK once budget and retry controls are in place

## 2026-05-02 10:01 America/Chicago

Task:
- implement the next five Wave LLM framework backend items

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added explicit Wave LLM task execution response/request contracts
- added `POST /api/tools/waves/llm/tasks/{task_id}/execute`
- added deterministic `fixture` execution adapter for no-network validation
- added gated `ollama` live-local execution path with explicit `allowNetwork`, request budget, timeout, retry, and no-silent-fallback behavior
- kept OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google, OpenRouter, OpenClaw, and custom providers capability-detected only until their adapters are separately implemented and tested
- added action allowlisting and prompt-injection/forbidden-action risk flags so weak/local model output stays babysat
- updated the Wave LLM framework doc and notified Manager AI through `app/docs/alerts.md`

- `app/server/tests/test_wave_monitor.py`

Validation:
- `python -m compileall app/server/src`
- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_wave_monitor.py -q`

Blockers or caveats:
- cloud provider execution adapters remain intentionally blocked/not implemented
- Ollama execution requires explicit network permission and a positive request budget
- LLM output remains review-only and cannot promote sources, change reputation, activate connectors, or create trusted facts
- existing Pydantic schema alias warnings still appear during route tests

Next recommended task:
- add mocked OpenAI/OpenRouter adapter tests and a shared provider adapter interface before allowing any cloud BYOK live calls

## 2026-05-02 10:23 America/Chicago

Task:
- implement the top-five next backend items for Wave LLM execution and Source Discovery learning

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added a shared Wave LLM adapter execution seam so provider execution now runs through one request-budgeted, retry-aware, review-gated contract
- added deterministic mock execution paths for `openai` and `openrouter` plus the gated local `ollama` path without enabling live cloud calls
- added `POST /api/source-discovery/jobs/record-source-extract` so existing Wave Monitor records and bounded Data AI item batches can seed shared source memory
- added canonical URL/domain dedupe, alias preservation, and source-memory fields for `canonical_url`, `domain_scope`, `next_check_at`, and health-check failure count
- added source-health backoff scheduling and source-class-aware scoring/timeliness handling so static sources are not treated like stale live feeds
- updated the shared Wave LLM and Source Discovery framework docs and notified Manager AI through `app/docs/alerts.md`

Blockers or caveats:
- live cloud-provider execution remains disabled; `openai` and `openrouter` are mock-only execution paths in this slice
- Source Discovery still lacks a production article-body extractor, operator review UI, and background service wiring beyond the bounded API tick
- existing Pydantic schema alias warnings still appear during route tests

Next recommended task:
- add bounded feed/article-body extraction adapters and runtime scheduler-service wiring before expanding autonomous discovery breadth

## 2026-05-02 11:02 America/Chicago

Task:
- implement the next five backend items for Source Discovery runtime, review, and scheduler integration

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added `POST /api/source-discovery/jobs/feed-link-scan` so one allowed public feed batch can create candidate memories plus summary snapshots
- improved content snapshots with lightweight HTML article title/body/meta extraction so later review is not headline-only by default
- added `GET /api/source-discovery/review/queue` and `POST /api/source-discovery/review/actions` with owner-lane assignment and review-action audit rows
- added scheduler-driven review-only Wave LLM `source_summary` task creation from eligible stored snapshots
- added a process-local runtime scheduler coordinator, startup wiring, and `GET /api/source-discovery/runtime/status` for Source Discovery and Wave Monitor loops
- extended source-discovery scheduler storage and responses with record-extract and Wave LLM execution counts
- updated the Source Discovery, Wave LLM, and 7Po8 integration docs and notified Manager AI through `app/docs/alerts.md`

Blockers or caveats:
- runtime scheduler loops are process-local and opt-in, not OS-managed services
- HTML article extraction is still a conservative first-pass parser, not a production readability engine
- scheduler-created Wave LLM output remains strictly review-only and cannot promote sources or facts
- existing Pydantic schema alias warnings still appear during route tests

Next recommended task:
- add a bounded catalog-scan job plus a stronger article extraction path, or build the operator-facing UI for the review queue and runtime status

## 2026-05-02 12:19 America/Chicago

Task:
- implement the ten-step Phase 2 backend plan for Source Discovery runtime, bounded ingestion, reviewed claim application, and Wave LLM execution

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added source memory list/detail/export surfaces:
  - `GET /api/source-discovery/memory/list`
  - `GET /api/source-discovery/memory/{source_id}`
  - `GET /api/source-discovery/memory/{source_id}/export`
- added bounded source-discovery jobs:
  - `POST /api/source-discovery/jobs/catalog-scan`
  - `POST /api/source-discovery/jobs/article-fetch`
  - `POST /api/source-discovery/jobs/social-metadata`
- strengthened article extraction so HTML snapshots store structured body/title/author/published/canonical metadata with fallback behavior and extraction confidence
- added reviewed-claim application through `POST /api/source-discovery/reviews/apply-claims`; accepted Wave LLM claims now affect source reputation only after explicit source review plus approved application
- added persistent runtime worker/run storage plus `POST /api/source-discovery/runtime/workers/{worker_name}/control` for pause, resume, stop, and run-now
- added conservative lease-safe scheduler behavior so duplicate backend instances skip rather than double-run workers
- extended scheduler-created Wave LLM work so eligible full-text snapshots can create review-only `article_claim_extraction` tasks, not just `source_summary`
- upgraded the OpenAI adapter from capability-only/mock-contract posture to a live BYOK path with explicit network permission, budget, retry, timeout, audit, and no silent fallback
- updated shared docs and notified Manager AI through `app/docs/alerts.md`

Blockers or caveats:
- runtime scheduler loops are still process-local preview loops even though worker state and lease checks are now persisted
- article extraction is stronger than the first-pass parser but still not a production readability engine
- public social/image support is metadata-only in this slice
- OpenRouter and the other cloud/provider families remain mock-only or capability-only
- existing Pydantic schema alias warnings still appear during route tests

Next recommended task:
- replace the bounded HTML parser with a stronger article-body extraction path, then add operator-facing UI for source packet review, runtime worker control, and reviewed-claim application

## 2026-05-02 12:49 America/Chicago

Task:
- close the remaining Phase 2 backend caveats around runtime service deployment, public social/image evidence capture, article readability extraction, live provider adapters, and noisy route-test warnings

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added a dedicated runtime worker entrypoint at `app/server/src/runtime_worker.py` so Source Discovery and Wave Monitor can run outside the API process as long-lived worker processes
- extended runtime status with deployment guidance plus `GET /api/source-discovery/runtime/services` that emits user-level Windows Task Scheduler, macOS launchd, and Linux systemd-user service artifacts for both workers
- replaced the bounded HTML extraction path with a shared semantic extractor in `app/server/src/services/content_extraction.py`
- upgraded article extraction to prefer JSON-LD article bodies when present, otherwise use a readability-style block scorer before falling back to full-page text
- upgraded social/image jobs from metadata-only capture to bounded public page evidence capture: canonical URL, media URLs, captions, alt text, evidence text, and media hints while still refusing private or blob-heavy routes
- implemented live BYOK execution paths for `openrouter`, `anthropic`, `xai`, `google`, and `openclaw` in addition to the existing `openai`, `ollama`, and deterministic mock paths
- added route and provider tests for the new runtime-service, extraction, and adapter surfaces
- suppressed the noisy FastAPI/Pydantic alias warning category for normal pytest route runs; standard route suites are now clean even though forcing `-W default` can still surface the upstream library warning path

Blockers or caveats:
- explicit pytest warning overrides such as `-W default` can still surface the upstream FastAPI/Pydantic alias warning path even though normal route-test runs are clean
- runtime service artifacts are generated and validated as deployment templates in this slice; actual OS-level installation still depends on the target machine and user environment

Next recommended task:
- wire the generated runtime worker/service artifacts into the desktop/backend packaging path, then add operator-facing UI for runtime worker control and source evidence review

## 2026-05-04 21:37 America/Chicago

Task:
- implement the first two current platform priorities: real runtime install/manage support and a single-page operator control surface, then save the full current top-five platform queue in the planning doc with media/OCR/AI called out as a major next slice

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added runtime path resolution inputs to backend settings and a shared runtime path resolver for resource, user-data, cache, log, and service-artifact roots
- extended Source Discovery runtime status and service bundle contracts with runtime paths plus persisted service-installation state
- added persisted runtime service installation and action audit tables in the Source Discovery SQLite schema
- added `POST /api/source-discovery/runtime/services/{worker_name}/actions` with local materialize/install/start/restart/stop/status/uninstall actions for Windows Task Scheduler, macOS launchd, and Linux systemd-user worker deployment
- added Wave LLM review listing via `GET /api/tools/waves/llm/reviews` so reviewed claim packets can be surfaced to operators without guessing review ids
- added a single-page operator console in the main client shell for:
  - runtime status and runtime paths
  - worker pause/resume/run-now/stop controls
  - service install/lifecycle actions
  - Source Discovery review queue actions
  - reviewed Wave LLM claim application
- updated the cross-platform implementation playbook with the current platform operating queue:
  - runtime install/manage path
  - single-page operator control surface
  - secure BYOK/provider management
  - media evidence/OCR/AI enrichment
  - end-to-end runtime and packaging validation
- updated the Source Discovery platform plan so it no longer falsely says there is no frontend review queue or no OS-managed deployment path

Blockers or caveats:
- the new service actions are real local-management paths, but success still depends on the target machine's service manager, permissions, and host environment
- the operator console is a desktop/full-app surface only in this slice; companion-web parity still needs to be built
- media/OCR/AI enrichment is still the next major follow-on, not part of this implementation

Next recommended task:
- build the secure BYOK/provider management surface, then start the bounded media evidence/OCR/AI enrichment layer on top of the new operator/runtime foundation

## 2026-05-04 22:19 America/Chicago

Task:
- implement the current platform item `3` by adding managed Wave LLM BYOK/provider configuration, per-wave overrides, operator-console controls, and execution-history visibility; then prep platform item `4` with a dedicated media/OCR/AI quality plan

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added a shared Wave LLM provider-config service that stores local provider settings under user data, masks saved secrets in API responses, resolves global defaults, and resolves per-wave provider/model/budget/timeout overrides
- added new Wave LLM config routes:
  - `GET /api/tools/waves/llm/config`
  - `POST /api/tools/waves/llm/config/defaults`
  - `POST /api/tools/waves/llm/config/providers/{provider}`
  - `POST /api/tools/waves/llm/config/monitors/{monitor_id}`
  - `GET /api/tools/waves/llm/executions`
- added Wave LLM execution-history persistence and per-wave provider-preference persistence in the Wave Monitor SQLite schema
- updated Wave LLM task creation and execution so provider/model/network/budget/retry/timeout resolution comes from one managed config path instead of raw env defaults
- updated Source Discovery scheduler-created Wave LLM tasks to inherit per-wave provider/model preferences when no explicit scheduler override is supplied
- expanded the single-page operator console to include:
  - global Wave LLM defaults
  - per-provider config editing
  - per-wave provider overrides
  - recent provider execution history
- added a quality-plan doc for the long media-evidence slice so future OCR/image/AI work starts from explicit provenance and review rules
- added a small analyst-workbench timeline coverage rule so mixed timelines keep at least one Wave Monitor item when that lane is requested and data volume from other lanes would otherwise crowd it out

Blockers or caveats:
- provider secrets are masked in API responses and stored under local user data, but OS keychain integration is still future work
- the operator console now manages Wave LLM provider state in the full app only; companion-web parity still needs to be built
- the media/OCR/AI slice is still intentionally unimplemented here; the new quality-plan doc is the prep boundary, not the full feature build

Next recommended task:
- start the bounded media-artifact layer from `app/docs/media-evidence-ocr-ai-quality-plan.md`, beginning with artifact identity, deterministic metadata capture, OCR scaffolding, and perceptual/media dedupe before broad visual AI interpretation work

## 2026-05-04 22:59 America/Chicago

Task:
- implement the current platform item `4` by adding a local-first media-evidence layer for Source Discovery, including bounded public artifact capture, OCR, and review-only place/scene/time interpretation

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added a new media-evidence backend service for bounded public image artifact capture, MIME sniffing, hashing, local runtime storage, dimension parsing, and optional richer Pillow-backed inspection
- added persistent Source Discovery media tables for artifacts, OCR runs, and interpretation runs
- added new Source Discovery media routes:
  - `GET /api/source-discovery/media/by-source/{source_id}`
  - `GET /api/source-discovery/media/artifacts/{artifact_id}`
  - `POST /api/source-discovery/jobs/media-artifact-fetch`
  - `POST /api/source-discovery/jobs/media-ocr`
  - `POST /api/source-discovery/jobs/media-interpret`
- added fixture OCR plus local `tesseract` OCR support with raw text, confidence, block geometry, preprocessing metadata, and OCR-to-snapshot linkage
- added deterministic scene/place/time-of-day/season/geolocation clue extraction from media metadata, OCR text, captions, and bounded pixel heuristics
- added optional local `ollama` scene/place interpretation behind explicit enablement, localhost-only routing, and strict no-people-recognition guardrails
- extended Source Discovery memory detail and export packets so media artifacts, OCR runs, and interpretation lineage are inspectable with the rest of source memory
- updated shared planning docs so the repo now treats the media/OCR/place-recognition slice as implemented backend infrastructure instead of future-only planning
- fixed claim-support fallback logic in Source Discovery so corroborating and corrective claim application remains consistent across nearby snapshots and duplicate classifications

- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_source_discovery_memory.py app/server/tests/test_wave_monitor.py app/server/tests/test_analyst_workbench.py -q`

Blockers or caveats:
- local `tesseract` OCR works only when the binary is installed on the host; fixture OCR remains the fallback for tests
- local `ollama` scene/place interpretation is optional and requires explicit enablement plus a localhost model route
- people recognition, identity analysis, accusation workflows, and broad video understanding remain intentionally out of scope
- this is a strong first-pass media layer, not yet a production-grade readability-equivalent engine for arbitrary image/video interpretation

Next recommended task:
- build bounded image-to-image comparison, stronger media dedupe, and optional higher-quality local OCR/vision model adapters before expanding into frame/video workflows

## 2026-05-04 23:44 America/Chicago

Task:
- implement Media Evidence Phase 2.5 for Source Discovery: still-image comparison, duplicate clustering, OCR adapter fallback, localhost-only local vision adapters, and bounded frame-sequence sampling

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added the remaining Source Discovery media routes for manual comparison detail/job access and bounded frame-sequence sampling:
  - `GET /api/source-discovery/media/comparisons/{comparison_id}`
  - `GET /api/source-discovery/media/sequences/{sequence_id}`
  - `POST /api/source-discovery/jobs/media-compare`
  - `POST /api/source-discovery/jobs/media-frame-sample`
- extended media artifact persistence so same-hash captures are no longer collapsed before comparison when their URL/context differs, while bounded frame sampling can also keep identical frames as separate artifacts
- implemented deterministic media comparison scoring with comparison records, duplicate-cluster updates, auto media signals, and pending-claim confidence nudging that does not change source reputation directly
- completed OCR adapter fallback plumbing so `tesseract` can defer to `rapidocr_onnx`, with stored attempt history, selected-result tracking, and disagreement caveats
- completed localhost-only OpenAI-compatible local vision adapter routing alongside deterministic and `ollama` scene/place interpretation paths
- completed bounded frame-sequence ingestion with stored sequence rows, per-frame artifacts, adjacent-frame comparisons, and first-versus-last comparisons
- expanded Source Discovery detail/export packets so duplicate clusters, comparisons, auto media signals, and frame sequences are now visible to operators and future agents
- updated shared docs so platform planning no longer describes comparison and bounded frame sampling as future-only work

- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_source_discovery_memory.py app/server/tests/test_wave_monitor.py app/server/tests/test_analyst_workbench.py -q`

Blockers or caveats:
- duplicate clustering, OCR fallback, and frame-sequence sampling are now implemented, but higher-grade packaging/distribution for optional local OCR and vision runtimes is still future work
- comparison signals can raise or lower pending review-claim confidence, but they still do not create final truth outcomes or source-reputation changes without explicit reviewed application
- bounded frame sampling works with fixture input today and with `ffmpeg` when present on the host, but this is still not a broad video-understanding system

Next recommended task:
- harden the media stack for production packaging and operator use: optional dependency install guidance, richer comparison/change heuristics, stronger OCR/model health reporting, and better review UX around duplicate clusters and frame sequences

## 2026-05-05 09:57 America/Chicago

Task:
- add a dedicated media geolocation framework for Source Discovery, covering docs, storage, routes, and initial adapter scaffolding for GeoCLIP, StreetCLIP, and local VLM clue analysts

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- added `app/docs/media-geolocation-framework.md` to define the model roles, guardrails, runtime posture, and current implementation contract for media geolocation inside 11Writer
- updated shared platform docs so media geolocation is now described as a dedicated review-first backend lane rather than an implied side effect of generic media interpretation
- added dedicated Source Discovery geolocation storage with persisted media geolocation run records linked to artifacts, OCR runs, and prior interpretations
- added new Source Discovery media geolocation API surfaces:
  - `POST /api/source-discovery/jobs/media-geolocate`
  - `GET /api/source-discovery/media/geolocations/{geolocation_run_id}`
- extended artifact detail plus source-memory detail/export packets so geolocation runs now travel with media artifacts, OCR runs, comparisons, interpretations, and frame sequences
- added deterministic geolocation candidate extraction from observed coordinates, OCR/caption coordinate pairs, and prior media place/geolocation hypotheses
- added review-first adapter scaffolding for:
  - `geoclip`
  - `streetclip`
  - `ollama`
  - `openai_compat_local`
  - `qwen_vl_local`
  - `internvl_local`
  - `llava_local`
- kept specialized geolocation engines explicitly gated so the framework can exist now without pretending the heavier local runtime packages are already production-ready everywhere
- added fixture-safe tests covering deterministic media geolocation, detail/export lineage, and localhost-only local analyst fallback behavior

Blockers or caveats:
- GeoCLIP and StreetCLIP are framework-ready but still explicitly gated behind optional local runtime setup; this slice does not pretend those heavyweight dependencies are already packaged or benchmarked everywhere
- local VLM clue analysts remain localhost-only and review-only, and they may fall back to deterministic clues when unavailable
- deterministic geolocation is useful now, but landmark dictionaries, better clue extraction, and benchmark harnesses are still needed before the geolocation lane should be treated as mature
- `git diff --check` reported only LF/CRLF warnings on touched files

Next recommended task:
- harden the specialized local geolocation runtime: package GeoCLIP and StreetCLIP more safely, improve deterministic landmark/script/terrain clues, and add a benchmarked fusion/evaluation lane before widening operator reliance on media geolocation

## 2026-05-05 10:35 America/Chicago

Task:
- implement the Media Geolocation Hardening Plan across Source Discovery media evidence and geolocation backend services

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 15:08 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- upgraded media geolocation from a thin candidate list into a structured clue-engine workflow with persisted coordinate, place-text, script/language, environment, time, and rejected-clue packets
- added deterministic parsing for decimal coordinates, DMS coordinates, directional `N/S/E/W` coordinates, UTM/MGRS-like references, bounded place phrases, transit/operator tokens, script-family hints, and time/environment heuristics
- added duplicate-cluster and frame-sequence lineage inheritance so related artifacts can contribute down-weighted clues with explicit artifact/run/comparison provenance
- hardened GeoCLIP and StreetCLIP runtime posture with explicit local cache/weights configuration, pinned-version checks, warm/cold runtime state, and no-surprise-download behavior by default
- unified local VLM clue-analysis outputs behind a stricter JSON contract with negative-evidence capture and localhost-only enforcement
- replaced simple ranking with scored fusion that preserves confidence score, confidence ceiling, supporting evidence, contradicting evidence, engine agreement, and provenance chain per candidate
- extended stored geolocation runs, detail surfaces, and export packets so clue packets, engine-attempt audits, inherited lineage, and richer candidate metadata are persisted and surfaced together
- added a repo-safe media geolocation evaluation harness plus manifests and CLI for deterministic regression, distance-band scoring, clue-family recall, and engine-unavailable reporting
- added targeted regression tests for structured clue packets, unavailable specialized-engine attempts, inherited cluster lineage, and the evaluation harness

Blockers or caveats:
- GeoCLIP and StreetCLIP are now runtime-disciplined and auditable, but they still depend on optional local heavyweight packages and prepared local model assets
- deterministic clue extraction is materially better now, but landmark dictionaries and richer regional label banks are still future quality work
- evaluation is fixture-safe and repeatable now, but wider external benchmark manifests are still optional follow-on work for high-end local installs

Next recommended task:
- build the next operator-facing quality layer on top of this backend: map preview, candidate comparison UI, and better landmark/label-bank enrichment for review workflows

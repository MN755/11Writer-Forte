## 2026-05-05 23:58 America/Chicago

Assignment version:
- 2026-05-05 23:58 America/Chicago

Task:
- finish the current marine slice at the smallest coherent checkpoint and write the Phase 3 Marine AI handoff packet

What changed:
- confirmed the active bounded checkpoint was already complete:
  - GEBCO static bathymetry slice is implemented
  - NAVTEX, hydrology, infrastructure, and export/reporting surfaces are already coherent enough to hand off
- wrote the Phase 3 Marine AI handoff packet at:
  - [marine-ai.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/phase3-handoffs/marine-ai.md)
- documented for incoming Phase 3 work:
  - scope completed
  - current marine state
  - files and surfaces to know
  - validation already run
  - known blockers and caveats
  - what the next AI should do first
  - what not to break
  - Phase 3 relevance for Reporting AI, Platform AI, and Connect AI
- made the handoff explicit about:
  - replay evidence versus contextual layers
  - static bathymetry versus warning/hydrology context
  - no-inference and no-intent guardrails

Files touched:
- [marine-ai.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/phase3-handoffs/marine-ai.md)
- [marine-ai.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/agent-progress/marine-ai.md)

Validation:
- no new code-path validation rerun
- reason:
  - this checkpoint was docs-only
  - the active GEBCO slice and marine stack were already validated in the prior completed checkpoint

Blockers or caveats:
- no fresh source expansion was started
- no new validation claims were added beyond already completed checkpoints
- shared frontend lint still has the previously documented non-marine blocker in `AppShell.tsx`

Next recommended task:
- let the incoming Phase 3 AI start from the handoff packet and existing marine docs rather than reconstructing the lane from old chat history

## 2026-05-05 22:17 America/Chicago

Assignment version:
- 2026-05-05 22:17 America/Chicago

Task:
- implement one bounded static-context marine follow-on centered on GEBCO Gridded Bathymetry

What changed:
- added a bounded fixture-first GEBCO static-context backend slice at:
  - `GET /api/marine/context/gebco-bathymetry`
- added marine-only backend settings, typed contracts, service wiring, and route wiring for GEBCO bathymetry
- preserved strict static-context boundaries:
  - pinned `GEBCO_2026` grid version
  - `15` arc-second grid-resolution posture
  - bounded sample-point and compact area-summary lookup only
  - source provenance through official GEBCO docs/download URLs
  - explicit source health, source mode, caveats, and no-inference wording
- added focused backend coverage for:
  - loaded contract behavior
  - empty/no-match behavior
  - disabled non-fixture behavior
  - honest stale classification from an old pinned grid-release timestamp
  - honest unavailable classification from fixture retrieval failure
  - request validation for coordinates and radius
- added marine-local client/query/helper/card/export integration for GEBCO:
  - query hook
  - static-context helper
  - compact GEBCO card
  - `marineAnomalySummary.gebcoBathymetryContext`
- kept GEBCO intentionally separate from:
  - NAVTEX advisory warning context
  - hydrology context family rollups
  - live incident truth
  - closure, route-safety, vessel-behavior, vessel-intent, or action-need claims
- extended deterministic helper regression and marine smoke to cover the GEBCO card plus export metadata block
- updated marine docs to record the exact GEBCO contract, fixture coverage, smoke/export status, and static-context guardrails

  - current repo-wide blocker:
    - [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx:2686)
    - `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` missing dependencies `noaaNowCoastLayerCatalogQuery.data` and `nwsAlertsRecentQuery.data`

Blockers or caveats:
- GEBCO remains bounded static seafloor context only.
- No broad raster ingest, live-network behavior, warning-family merge, hydrology-family merge, or viewer scraping was added.
- GEBCO intentionally does not emit `degraded` in the current slice because there is no honest partial-metadata/source-quality degradation path.
- The remaining lint blocker is outside marine in shared `AppShell.tsx`.
- No anomaly scoring changed.
- No route-safety, closure-truth, grounding-risk, incident-truth, vessel-behavior, vessel-intent, or action-guidance inference was added.

Next recommended task:
- wait for Manager AI to assign the next bounded marine source or reporting follow-on now that GEBCO static context is contract-covered, export-covered, and marine-smoke-covered

## 2026-05-05 19:41 America/Chicago

Assignment version:
- 2026-05-05 19:41 America/Chicago

Task:
- implement a bounded marine source wave centered on Navtex

What changed:
- added a bounded fixture-first NAVTEX source slice centered on official NAVCEN-published GovDelivery RSS feeds
- added backend settings, typed contracts, service wiring, route wiring, and focused fixture-first backend tests for:
  - `GET /api/marine/context/navtex`
- preserved advisory warning semantics:
  - source family/category remains distinct from hydrology, ocean/met, and infrastructure context
  - message-family filtering separates navigational warnings, meteorological warnings, SAR, forecast, and other subjects
  - source health/freshness remains explicit through `loaded`, `empty`, `stale`, `degraded`, `disabled`, and `unavailable`
  - caveats explicitly forbid closure certainty, legal-status, required-action, threat, vessel-behavior, and vessel-intent claims
- added marine-local client/query/helper/card/export integration for NAVTEX:
  - query hook
  - context helper
  - marine card
  - context source summary row
  - context fusion warning-family row
  - `marineAnomalySummary.navtexContext`
- extended deterministic helper regression and marine smoke to cover the new NAVTEX card, source-summary row, fusion family, and export metadata block
- updated marine docs to reflect the actual seven-source marine context stack and corrected the outdated Waterinfo smoke note
- no bounded GEBCO/static follow-on was added in this assignment; the wave stayed centered on NAVTEX only

Blockers or caveats:
- NAVTEX remains bounded to advisory warning context only.
- No broad viewer ingestion, no live-network tests, and no GEBCO/static follow-on were added in this slice.
- Official live URL family is documented as NAVCEN-published GovDelivery RSS feeds, but the implementation remains fixture-first in this phase.

Next recommended task:
- if Manager AI wants a follow-on from the same user-priority lane, add one small static bathymetry/context helper only if it stays officially sourced, inert, export-safe, and semantically separate from warning context

## 2026-05-05 19:35 America/Chicago

Assignment version:
- 2026-05-05 19:35 America/Chicago

Task:
- build a bounded marineQuestionBriefingPacket on top of the current marine reporting stack

What changed:
- added [marineQuestionBriefingPacket.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineQuestionBriefingPacket.ts) as a pure bounded export/reporting helper over the existing marine reporting stack
- the new packet builds on:
  - `marineFusionSnapshotInput`
  - `marineReportBriefPackage`
  - `marineCorridorSituationPackage`
  - `marineHydrologyRegionalComparisonPackage`
  - `marineCurrentAwarenessDigest`
  - `marineSourceRowWorkflowClosurePacket`
- it preserves, in one export-only artifact:
  - active area, corridor, or hydrology question posture
  - source-row posture and source-health posture
  - corridor or chokepoint posture where present
  - hydrology posture where present
  - workflow-evidence and export-coherence posture
  - review or readiness gaps
  - export-safe briefing lines
  - `observe`, `orient`, `prioritize`, and `explain`
  - explicit does-not-prove lines
- added Node-resolution shims for the new helper:
  - [marineQuestionBriefingPacket](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineQuestionBriefingPacket)
  - [marineQuestionBriefingPacket.js](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineQuestionBriefingPacket.js)
- extended [marineEvidenceSummary.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineEvidenceSummary.ts) so `marineAnomalySummary.questionBriefingPacket` is exported and one compact question-briefing line is appended to the existing marine display/export lines
- extended [marineContextHelperRegression.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/marineContextHelperRegression.mjs) so the real marine export path now regression-checks:
  - question-family posture
  - source-row/source-health carry-through
  - corridor/chokepoint and hydrology posture carry-through
  - workflow-evidence/export-coherence carry-through
  - no-impact/no-closure/no-wrongdoing/no-action guardrails
  - carry-through through `buildMarineEvidenceSummary(...)`
- extended [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) so marine smoke now checks the `marineAnomalySummary.questionBriefingPacket` metadata block, including question posture, source rows, workflow-evidence wording, and explicit no-closure guardrails
- updated marine docs and validation notes so the new packet is documented as export-covered, regression-covered, and smoke metadata-covered without promoting any source beyond its evidence:
  - [marine-module.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/marine-module.md)

- `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json` -> pass

Blockers or caveats:
- `marineQuestionBriefingPacket` is export-only and intentionally does not add a new large marine UI panel
- it packages question posture, source-row/source-health posture, corridor/chokepoint posture, hydrology posture, workflow-evidence posture, and export-coherence posture only
- it does not imply impact, closure certainty, causation, wrongdoing, threat, action need, vessel intent, escort/payment, or evasion
- one intermediate marine smoke run briefly reported the new key missing, but the rerun after the completed integration/build path was green and no launcher-permission issue occurred
- no live-network tests
- no broad portal or viewer ingestion
- no real-time crisis or geopolitical claims

Next recommended task:
- wait for Manager AI to assign the next bounded marine reporting/briefing follow-through task

## 2026-05-05 18:15 America/Chicago

Assignment version:
- 2026-05-05 18:15 America/Chicago

Task:
- build a bounded marineHydrologyRegionalComparisonPackage on top of the current marine reporting stack

What changed:
- added [marineHydrologyRegionalComparisonPackage.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineHydrologyRegionalComparisonPackage.ts) as a pure bounded hydrology comparison helper over the existing marine reporting stack
- the new package builds on:
  - `marineFusionSnapshotInput`
  - `marineReportBriefPackage`
  - `marineHydrologySourceHealthReport`
- it preserves, in one export-only hydrology artifact:
  - source ids, source modes, and source health posture
  - evidence basis and workflow-evidence posture
  - latest timestamp or freshness posture
  - regional/source-row comparison posture
  - review/readiness gaps
  - export-safe lines
  - `observe`, `orient`, `prioritize`, and `explain`
  - explicit does-not-prove lines
- added Node-resolution shims for the new helper:
  - [marineHydrologyRegionalComparisonPackage](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineHydrologyRegionalComparisonPackage)
  - [marineHydrologyRegionalComparisonPackage.js](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineHydrologyRegionalComparisonPackage.js)
- extended [marineEvidenceSummary.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineEvidenceSummary.ts) so `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologyRegionalComparisonPackage` is exported and one compact hydrology-comparison line is appended to the existing marine display/export lines
- extended [marineContextHelperRegression.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/marineContextHelperRegression.mjs) so the real marine export path now regression-checks:
  - hydrology comparison posture
  - hydrology row count
  - Vigicrues workflow-evidence wording
  - Waterinfo workflow-evidence wording
  - OPW workflow-evidence wording
  - no-impact/no-closure/no-action guardrails
  - carry-through through `buildMarineEvidenceSummary(...)`
- extended [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) so marine smoke now checks the `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologyRegionalComparisonPackage` metadata block, including hydrology rows, workflow-evidence wording, and the explicit no-impact guardrail
- updated marine docs and validation notes so the hydrology comparison artifact is documented as export-covered, regression-covered, and smoke metadata-covered without promoting any source beyond its evidence:

## 2026-05-05 09:47 America/Chicago

Assignment version:
- 2026-05-05 09:47 America/Chicago

Task:
- build a bounded marineReportBriefPackage on top of marineFusionSnapshotInput and tighten workflow-evidence wording for Vigicrues and Waterinfo

What changed:
- added [marineReportBriefPackage.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineReportBriefPackage.ts) as a pure marine export/reporting helper that converts the existing `marineFusionSnapshotInput` into stable report-ready sections:
  - `observe`
  - `orient`
  - `prioritize`
  - `explain`
- the new package preserves replay/gap posture, source rows, hydrology posture, corridor/chokepoint posture, attention/review counts, caveats, and does-not-prove lines without creating a new UI panel or a new severity model
- added Node-resolution shims for the new helper:
  - [marineReportBriefPackage](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineReportBriefPackage)
  - [marineReportBriefPackage.js](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineReportBriefPackage.js)
- tightened explicit workflow-evidence wording for the two hydrology sources called out in the assignment:
  - Vigicrues now has a dedicated `vigicruesWorkflowEvidenceLine` in the report brief
  - Waterinfo now has a dedicated `waterinfoWorkflowEvidenceLine` in the report brief
  - both lines confirm export-path/source-health/evidence-basis presence only and do not promote either source into behavioral, crisis, or impact evidence
- extended [marineEvidenceSummary.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineEvidenceSummary.ts) so `marineAnomalySummary.reportBriefPackage` is exported and one compact report-brief line is added to the existing marine display/export lines

## 2026-05-05 00:00 America/Chicago



Assignment version:

- 2026-05-04 23:26 America/Chicago



Task:

- build a bounded marineFusionSnapshotInput package from the existing marine evidence, hydrology, corridor, replay, source-health, and export surfaces



What changed:

- added [marineFusionSnapshotInput.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineFusionSnapshotInput.ts) as a pure marine export/reporting helper that composes:

  - replay posture from focused replay evidence and focused interpretation trust

  - source rows from the existing corridor/source-health stack with ids, mode, health, evidence basis, nearby/active counts, latest timestamp posture, and caveats

  - hydrology posture from the existing hydrology source-health report, including the explicit Vigicrues status line when present

  - corridor/chokepoint posture from the existing corridor and chokepoint review packages

  - compact caveats, does-not-prove lines, attention counts, review counts, and export-safe lines

- added Node-resolution shims for the new helper:

  - [marineFusionSnapshotInput](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineFusionSnapshotInput)

  - [marineFusionSnapshotInput.js](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineFusionSnapshotInput.js)

- extended [marineEvidenceSummary.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineEvidenceSummary.ts) so `marineAnomalySummary.fusionSnapshotInput` is exported and one compact fusion-snapshot line is added to the existing marine display/export lines

- extended [marineContextHelperRegression.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/marineContextHelperRegression.mjs) so the real marine export path now regression-checks:

  - fusion snapshot input source-row counts

  - Vigicrues carry-through

  - degraded corridor posture carry-through

  - no-intent/no-wrongdoing/no-action guardrails

  - top-level evidence-summary line carry-through

- extended [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) so marine smoke now checks the `marineAnomalySummary.fusionSnapshotInput` metadata block, including source rows, Vigicrues hydrology posture, corridor posture, and guardrail lines

- updated marine docs to record the new export-only package and its smoke/regression coverage:

- no live-network tests

- no broad portal/viewer ingestion

- no real-time crisis/geopolitical claims

- no vessel intent, wrongdoing, escort/payment, evasion, impact, pollution/health-risk modeling, navigation-safety conclusion, operational-failure conclusion, causation, threat, or action guidance

## 2026-05-04 23:03 America/Chicago



Assignment version:

- 2026-05-04 22:59 America/Chicago



Task:

- finish the active france-vigicrues-hydrometry follow-through across marine hydrology, source-health, and corridor review/export surfaces



What changed:

- inspected the existing Vigicrues backend slice, hydrology source-health workflow/report, corridor review package, export metadata wiring, and smoke/regression path before changing semantics

- extended [marineHydrologySourceHealthReport.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineHydrologySourceHealthReport.ts) so Vigicrues is now preserved explicitly inside the hydrology export package through:

  - `vigicruesRow`

  - `vigicruesStatusLine`

  - top-source export lines that now force a Vigicrues posture line when the row is present

- extended [marineCorridorReviewPackage.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineCorridorReviewPackage.ts) so corridor export metadata now preserves:

  - `vigicruesRow`

  - `vigicruesStatusLine`

  - `vigicruesCaveat`

- strengthened corridor package fallback behavior so it can still emit a bounded corridor review package when corridor/chokepoint signal exists but the narrower chokepoint helper package is absent; it derives review-safe counts and caveats from existing chokepoint summary, focused replay evidence, and source rows only

- extended [marineEvidenceSummary.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineEvidenceSummary.ts) so both packages export the new Vigicrues-specific metadata fields through `marineAnomalySummary`

- extended [marineContextHelperRegression.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/marineContextHelperRegression.mjs) so the Vigicrues follow-through is now regression-checked across:

  - broad posture with loaded Vigicrues

  - limited/degraded posture with unavailable Vigicrues

  - empty/stale posture with stale Vigicrues

  - missing-source posture with no fabricated Vigicrues row

  - drift through the real `buildMarineEvidenceSummary(...)` export path

- extended [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) so marine smoke now checks Vigicrues-integrated posture inside:

  - `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologySourceHealthReport`

  - `marineAnomalySummary.corridorReviewPackage`

  using row/status-line export-facing assertions rather than helper-private field shape

- updated marine docs and contract notes so Vigicrues follow-through is now documented as export-covered, regression-covered, and smoke metadata-covered in the hydrology and corridor package stack

- `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json` -> pass



Blockers or caveats:

- the Vigicrues follow-through stays package/export focused; no new large marine UI panel was added

- smoke coverage intentionally checks the export-visible Vigicrues row and status-line posture, not the helpers private internal field shape

- no live-network tests

- no broad portal/viewer ingestion

- no real-time crisis/geopolitical claims

- no vessel intent, wrongdoing, escort/payment, evasion, impact, pollution/health-risk modeling, navigation-safety conclusions, operational-failure conclusions, causation, threat, or action guidance

- no staging, commit, or push



Next recommended task:

- if Manager AI wants the next marine hardening slice, promote the same explicit row/posture/caveat coherence pattern to the remaining hydrology and infrastructure review/export packages where it adds export clarity without multiplying helper names

## 2026-05-04 22:05 America/Chicago



Assignment version:

- 2026-05-04 22:01 America/Chicago



Task:

- add a larger marine corridor/chokepoint review package using existing replay, gap/anomaly, environmental, hydrology, and source-health metadata



What changed:

- confirmed the previously reported Marine-owned lint/import issue does not reproduce in the current tree; `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint` was green before and after this assignment

- added the pure helper [marineCorridorReviewPackage.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineCorridorReviewPackage.ts)

- added the Node-resolution shims for that helper:

  - [marineCorridorReviewPackage](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineCorridorReviewPackage)

  - [marineCorridorReviewPackage.js](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineCorridorReviewPackage.js)

- the new package composes existing marine metadata from:

  - chokepoint/corridor review context

  - replay/gap/anomaly review counts

  - marine context source rows

  - environmental context posture

  - hydrology context posture

  - hydrology/source-health workflow report posture

- the new package exports a bounded review/export shape with:

  - `title`

  - `summaryLine`

  - `posture` (`normal`, `degraded`, `empty-no-match`, `missing-source`)

  - `sourceOverviewLine`

  - `replayOverviewLine`

  - `contextOverviewLine`

  - `explainLines`

  - `actLines`

  - `doesNotProveLines`

  - compact source rows containing source id, mode, health, evidence basis, nearby count, active count, and caveat

- wired `marineAnomalySummary.corridorReviewPackage` into [marineEvidenceSummary.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineEvidenceSummary.ts) and appended its top export line to the compact marine snapshot summary

- kept the helper UI-light and export-only; no new large marine panel was added

- extended [marineContextHelperRegression.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/marineContextHelperRegression.mjs) so the corridor package is regression-checked for:

  - normal posture

  - degraded posture

  - empty/no-match posture

  - missing-source posture

  - metadata drift through the real `buildMarineEvidenceSummary(...)` export path

  - contextual Scottish Water row preservation

  - explicit no-escort / no-wrongdoing / no-action-need guardrails

- extended [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) with metadata-only assertions for `marineAnomalySummary.corridorReviewPackage`

- updated marine docs and contract notes so the new corridor review package is documented as export-covered, regression-covered, and marine-smoke metadata-covered

Blockers or caveats:

- the corridor package is review/export-only and intentionally avoids a new UI panel

- the package uses existing corridor/bounded-area labels only; it does not add a live geopolitical or crisis model

- `actLines` are bounded to review/export mechanics only and are not operational guidance

- no anomaly scoring changes

- no real-time Hormuz/crisis claims, geopolitical assertions, vessel-intent claims, wrongdoing claims, escort/payment claims, evasion claims, impact claims, pollution/health-risk modeling, navigation-safety conclusions, operational-failure conclusions, causation claims, threat claims, or action guidance

- no staging, commit, or push



Next recommended task:

- if Manager AI wants the next marine hardening slice, extend corridor-review export coherence against additional empty/stale fixture combinations or add one narrow marine-local presentation surface for this package without broadening its semantics

## 2026-05-04 21:45 America/Chicago



Assignment version:

- 2026-05-04 21:43 America/Chicago



Task:

- fix the reported Marine-owned lint/import issue if it reproduces, then add a bounded report/export consumer for `hydrologySourceHealthWorkflow`



What changed:

- reproduced the reported Marine-owned lint path and confirmed it does not currently reproduce; `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint` stayed green before and after the change

- added the pure helper [marineHydrologySourceHealthReport.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineHydrologySourceHealthReport.ts)

- the new helper consumes `marineHydrologySourceHealthWorkflow` and emits a bounded review/export package with:

  - `title`

  - `summaryLine`

  - `posture` (`broad`, `limited`, `empty-stale`, `missing-source`)

  - `familyLines`

  - `rows`

  - `topSourceLines`

  - `doesNotProveLines`

  - `caveats`

- preserved, per row, the existing export-safe fields only:

  - source mode

  - source health

  - evidence basis

  - nearby station count

  - exported observation count

  - latest timestamp posture

  - source caveat

  - family grouping

- wired `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologySourceHealthReport` into [marineEvidenceSummary.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineEvidenceSummary.ts) and appended its top export line to the compact marine snapshot summary

- added the repoâs existing Node-resolution shim pattern for the new helper:

  - [marineHydrologySourceHealthReport](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineHydrologySourceHealthReport)

  - [marineHydrologySourceHealthReport.js](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineHydrologySourceHealthReport.js)

- extended [marineContextHelperRegression.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/marineContextHelperRegression.mjs) so the new report path is regression-checked for:

  - broad posture

  - limited posture

  - empty/stale posture

  - missing-source posture

  - metadata drift through the real `buildMarineEvidenceSummary(...)` export path

  - Waterinfo family classification in the report rows

  - preserved no-intent / no-wrongdoing guardrails

- extended [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) with metadata-only assertions for `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologySourceHealthReport`

- updated marine docs and contract notes so the new report block is documented as export-covered and regression-covered

- `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py marine` -> not trustworthy in current repo state; it failed expecting `hydrologySourceHealthReport` because the shared frontend build is blocked outside marine and the served bundle is stale

- `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json` -> pass



Blockers or caveats:

- the reported Marine-owned lint/import issue does not reproduce; no mechanical lint fix was needed

- the remaining build blocker is outside marine in the inspector subsystem, so I did not modify it

- because the shared frontend build is currently blocked outside marine, the marine smoke failure is classified as stale-bundle validation fallout rather than a confirmed marine app failure

- no large new marine UI panel was added; this remained a report/export-path change only

- no anomaly scoring changes

- no flood-impact, navigation-safety, operational-failure, anomaly-cause, vessel-behavior, vessel-intent, wrongdoing, pollution-impact, health-risk, targeting, or action-guidance claims

- no staging, commit, or push



Next recommended task:

- once the shared frontend build is green again, rerun marine smoke to confirm the new `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologySourceHealthReport` block through a fresh built bundle and then promote that path from regression-covered to clean smoke-confirmed




## 2026-05-04 21:32 America/Chicago





Assignment version:


- 2026-05-04 21:17 America/Chicago





Task:


- build a larger marine hydrology/source-health workflow package: unify France Vigicrues, Ireland OPW, Netherlands RWS Waterinfo, CO-OPS, and NDBC into a bounded hydrology/source-health export consumer with deterministic regression and smoke-prep coverage





What changed:


- determined the prior `2026-05-04 21:06 America/Chicago` final report was not present as a standalone entry and its narrow smoke-prep/export-consumer scope was absorbed into this completed assignment rather than backfilled as a fabricated separate report


- added the pure helper [marineHydrologySourceHealthWorkflow.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineHydrologySourceHealthWorkflow.ts)


- the new workflow package consumes existing `sourceHealthExportCoherence` output and preserves, per source, only bounded export-safe fields:


  - source mode


  - source health


  - evidence basis


  - nearby station count


  - exported-observation count


  - latest timestamp posture


  - caveat


- the workflow package groups those rows into:


  - `hydrology` family: Vigicrues, Ireland OPW, Netherlands RWS Waterinfo


  - `ocean-met` comparison family: NOAA CO-OPS, NOAA NDBC


- extended [marineEvidenceSummary.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineEvidenceSummary.ts) to export:


  - `marineAnomalySummary.sourceHealthExportCoherence`


  - `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologySourceHealthWorkflow`


- extended [marineContextHelperRegression.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/marineContextHelperRegression.mjs) so the new workflow package is regression-checked for:


  - broad vs limited source mixes


  - hydrology vs ocean/met family counts


  - latest timestamp posture preservation


  - metadata drift against top-level `marineAnomalySummary`


- added bounded marine smoke-prep/browser-path validation by:


  - adding the missing deterministic Waterinfo endpoint to [smoke_fixture_app.py](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/server/tests/smoke_fixture_app.py)


  - extending [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) to confirm snapshot metadata for `sourceHealthExportCoherence` and `hydrologySourceHealthWorkflow`


- updated marine docs so the validation truth now states the new metadata package is export-covered, helper-regression-covered, and smoke metadata-covered

- no flood-impact, navigation-safety, operational-failure, anomaly-cause, vessel-behavior, vessel-intent, wrongdoing, pollution-impact, health-risk, targeting, or action-guidance claims


- no dedicated new UI card was added for the workflow package; smoke coverage is metadata-only by design


- no staging, commit, or push





Next recommended task:


- if Manager AI wants the next marine hardening slice, add one narrow marine-owned consumer for `hydrologySourceHealthWorkflow` in a report/export view or keep the current metadata-only posture and extend fixture/state coverage for more honest empty/stale combinations





## 2026-05-02 16:18 America/Chicago





Assignment version:


- 2026-05-02 15:47 America/Chicago





Task:


- recover progress truth, then add a marine hydrology/source-health export coherence package across Waterinfo, Vigicrues, Ireland OPW, CO-OPS, and NDBC where current metadata supports honest comparison





What changed:


- replaced the stale `2026-05-02 12:27 America/Chicago` progress stub with the real completed Waterinfo consumer report


- added the pure helper [marineSourceHealthExportCoherence.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineSourceHealthExportCoherence.ts)


- the new helper summarizes, per source, only current export-safe metadata:


  - source mode


  - source health


  - evidence basis


  - nearby station count


  - exported-observation count


  - latest timestamp posture


  - caveat


- extended [marineNoaaContext.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineNoaaContext.ts) and [marineNdbcContext.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineNdbcContext.ts) so their summaries expose top observed timestamps when current metadata supports it


- wired `marineAnomalySummary.sourceHealthExportCoherence` into [marineEvidenceSummary.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineEvidenceSummary.ts) without adding a new UI surface


- added deterministic helper-regression coverage for broad vs limited source-health/export posture, timestamp-posture preservation, and metadata drift checks


- updated marine validation/docs so Waterinfo is no longer described as backend-only and the new export coherence block is documented

- no staging, commit, or push





Next recommended task:


- if Manager AI wants the next marine hardening slice, add one narrow deterministic smoke assertion or export-consumer check for `marineAnomalySummary.sourceHealthExportCoherence` so the new helper has a browser-path confirmation layer in addition to helper regression





## 2026-05-02 13:02 America/Chicago





Assignment version:


- 2026-05-02 12:27 America/Chicago





Task:


- add one narrow marine-local consumer/helper/export block for `netherlands-rws-waterinfo` without widening beyond metadata plus latest observations





What changed:


- added client API coverage for the backend Waterinfo contract in [api.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/types/api.ts)


- added `useMarineNetherlandsRwsWaterinfoContextQuery(...)` in [queries.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/lib/queries.ts)


- added the marine-local helper [marineNetherlandsRwsWaterinfoContext.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineNetherlandsRwsWaterinfoContext.ts)


- wired a compact `Netherlands RWS Waterinfo` card into [MarineAnomalySection.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/MarineAnomalySection.tsx)


- extended [marineHydrologyContext.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineHydrologyContext.ts) so Waterinfo joins the existing hydrology composition without changing source semantics


- extended [marineContextSourceSummary.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineContextSourceSummary.ts) so Waterinfo appears as `hydrology` / `observed` in the source registry


- added `marineAnomalySummary.netherlandsRwsWaterinfoContext` in [marineEvidenceSummary.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineEvidenceSummary.ts)


- extended deterministic helper regression coverage and marine docs for the Waterinfo consumer/export path

## 2026-05-02 12:38 America/Chicago





Assignment version:


- 2026-05-02 11:49 America/Chicago





Task:


- implement the bounded backend-first, fixture-first `netherlands-rws-waterinfo` marine context slice for official WaterWebservices metadata plus latest water-level observations





What changed:


- added a backend-first marine context route for Netherlands RWS Waterinfo:


  - `GET /api/marine/context/netherlands-rws-waterinfo`


- pinned the bounded official endpoint family in settings/contracts/docs:


  - `POST https://waterwebservices.apps.rijkswaterstaat.nl/ddapi20-waterwebservices/api/METADATASERVICES_DBO/OphalenCatalogus`


  - `POST https://waterwebservices.apps.rijkswaterstaat.nl/ddapi20-waterwebservices/api/ONLINEWAARNEMINGENSERVICES_DBO/OphalenLaatsteWaarnemingen`


- added marine-only backend settings for:


  - source mode


  - fixture path


  - metadata catalog URL


  - latest observations URL


  - timeout


- added typed backend contracts for:


  - source health


  - station metadata


  - latest water-level observation


  - context response


- added deterministic fixture behavior for:


  - one normal Hoek van Holland station


  - one IJmuiden station with prompt-like source text preserved as inert metadata


  - one Dordrecht partial-metadata station with missing `waterBody` and `unitLabel`


  - empty/no-match behavior


  - disabled non-fixture behavior


  - honest stale/degraded/unavailable source-health behavior


- added focused backend tests covering:


  - loaded contract behavior


  - empty result stays `health=empty`


  - partial metadata preservation


  - inert prompt-like source text preservation


  - disabled non-fixture behavior


  - fixture-mode no-fabrication boundary


  - stale/degraded/unavailable source-health behavior


  - invalid radius / invalid coordinates validation


- updated marine docs and directly relevant source/status docs so Waterinfo now reads as:


  - backend-contract-covered


  - backend-only in the current slice


  - still bounded to metadata plus latest water-level POST endpoints only

## 2026-05-02 16:41 America/Chicago





Assignment version:

Task:


- extend deterministic regression, metadata, and docs for marine anchor/radius/fallback transition coherence so selected-vessel, viewport/manual fallback, chokepoint bounded-area, and radius-change review lenses cannot drift across export and helper layers





What changed:


- updated [marineContextHelperRegression.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/marineContextHelperRegression.mjs)

    - selected-vessel anchored context


    - viewport/manual fallback context


    - chokepoint bounded-area context

    - `contextFusionSummary`


    - `contextReviewReport`


    - `contextTimeline`

    - top-level `marineAnomalySummary` caveats


  - added assertions that:


    - selected-vessel anchor metadata stays aligned across environmental context and timeline


    - viewport fallback preserves `effectiveAnchor=fallback-viewport`, fallback reason, and environmental caveats


    - chokepoint scope preserves `boundedAreaLabel` coherence between chokepoint review metadata and timeline snapshots

Task:


- build a deterministic marine chokepoint review/export helper that composes existing replay/context helpers, exposes review-only chokepoint metadata, and locks down no-intent/no-wrongdoing/no-impact wording through helper regression and export metadata coherence checks





What changed:


- added pp/client/src/features/marine/marineChokepointReviewPackage.ts


  - builds a compact review-only chokepoint package from existing chokepoint summary, focused replay evidence, focused interpretation, source summary, issue queue, issue export bundle, fusion summary, review report, hydrology context, and environmental context

  - adds metadata-coherence checks so marineAnomalySummary.chokepointReviewPackage matches the direct helper output without drift


- updated marine docs so the new chokepoint review/export package is documented in workflow validation and export metadata guidance


- added marine-local Node-resolution shims for the deterministic helper regression path:


  - pp/client/src/features/marine/marineChokepointReviewPackage

Assignment version:


- 2026-05-01 14:46 America/Chicago





Task:


- extend deterministic marine helper regression coverage so focused replay evidence and evidence interpretation export metadata stay coherent with the broader marine context review package outside browser-only smoke





What changed:


- extended pp/client/scripts/marineContextHelperRegression.mjs so it now builds a real uildMarineEvidenceSummary(...) package with deterministic focused replay evidence, focused evidence interpretation, selected vessel, viewport, chokepoint, NOAA CO-OPS, NOAA NDBC, Scottish Water, Vigicrues, Ireland OPW, hydrology, environmental context, source summary, issue queue, issue export bundle, fusion summary, and review report inputs


- added regression assertions that exported marineAnomalySummary preserves exact metadata coherence for:


  - contextFusionSummary

- 2026-05-01 13:24 America/Chicago





Task:


- extend the marine helper regression so it validates full exported `marineAnomalySummary` review-package coherence rather than only the individual fusion/review/export helpers





What changed:


- extended `app/client/scripts/marineContextHelperRegression.mjs` so it now builds the real marine review/export package through `buildMarineEvidenceSummary(...)`


- added deterministic fixture-summary inputs for:


  - NOAA CO-OPS


  - NOAA NDBC


  - Scottish Water Overflows


  - France Vigicrues Hydrometry


  - Ireland OPW Water Level


  - hydrology context


  - environmental context


  - focused evidence interpretation

Task:


- add a marine source-health issue export bundle plus helper-level regression coverage so degraded/unavailable-dominant marine context mixes keep no-severity/no-impact/no-intent guardrails outside Playwright smoke





What changed:


- added `marineContextIssueExportBundle.ts` to emit compact source-health export rows across CO-OPS, NDBC, Scottish Water, Vigicrues, and OPW with:


  - source family/category


  - source health and availability


  - source mode


  - evidence basis


  - primary caveat


  - allowed review action


  - explicit `does not prove` guardrails


- wired `marineEvidenceSummary.ts` and `MarineAnomalySection.tsx` so `marineAnomalySummary.contextIssueExportBundle` is exported with marine snapshot metadata and a compact export line


- added deterministic helper-level regression coverage in `app/client/scripts/marineContextHelperRegression.mjs` that exercises a degraded/unavailable-dominant source mix against the real marine helpers:


  - `marineContextFusionSummary.ts`


  - `marineContextReviewReport.ts`


  - `marineContextIssueQueue.ts`


  - `marineContextIssueExportBundle.ts`


- the regression now guards:


  - `partial context` dominant-limitation wording


  - no-severity / no-impact / no-vessel-intent phrasing


  - wrongdoing guardrails


  - family distinctions between oceanographic, meteorological, coastal-infrastructure, and hydrology rows


  - contextual-evidence preservation for Scottish Water and unavailable-state handling for Vigicrues

Task:


- add marine-local review/report phrasing safeguards so degraded or unavailable-heavy context mixes stay framed as partial context and source-health limitation rather than severity, impact, or anomaly-cause language





What changed:


- hardened `marineContextFusionSummary` so degraded/unavailable-heavy source mixes now emit explicit dominant-limitation phrasing:


  - `partial context`


  - `source-health limitations dominate current source mix`


  - review-caveat wording instead of severity wording


- fixed a marine semantic bug where degraded Scottish Water infrastructure context could previously collapse into `unavailable` instead of `limited`


- extended `marineContextReviewReport` so summary/export lines now preserve:


  - dominant-limitation phrasing when limited sources dominate


  - explicit review-caveat language


  - explicit `does not prove` guardrails covering impact, anomaly cause, vessel behavior, vessel intent, and wrongdoing


- updated deterministic marine smoke fixture posture so `Ireland OPW Water Level` is also surfaced as degraded, creating a marine-local smoke mix where degraded/unavailable sources dominate loaded sources


- hardened marine smoke assertions so the fusion/review surfaces and exported metadata must preserve:


  - partial-context wording


  - dominant-limitation wording


  - wrongdoing guardrail wording


- updated marine workflow/module/contract docs to record the new phrasing boundary and the degraded/unavailable-dominant smoke posture

Validation:

- `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` -> pass


- `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py marine` -> pass





Blockers or caveats:


- marine smoke executed successfully; it was not launcher-blocked before assertions


- the current deterministic smoke posture now proves review/report safeguards against severity drift when degraded/unavailable context dominates the source mix, but it does not change backend source-truth semantics


- degraded/unavailable context remains a source-health limitation and review caveat only; it is not anomaly severity, impact proof, anomaly-cause proof, vessel-behavior evidence, vessel-intent evidence, or wrongdoing evidence


- `degraded` remains intentionally absent for NOAA CO-OPS and NOAA NDBC because the current slice still has no honest partial-ingest/source-quality degradation signal there





Next recommended task:


- if Manager AI wants the next marine hardening slice, add targeted helper-level regression coverage for fusion/review phrasing so the dominant-limitation wording is tested outside the browser smoke path


## 2026-04-30 23:14 America/Chicago





Assignment version:


- 2026-04-30 22:05 America/Chicago





Task:


- add marine workflow/export/smoke coverage that visibly distinguishes degraded and unavailable context-source states without promoting them into anomaly severity, vessel behavior, or impact claims





What changed:


- updated marine-local source summary/export helpers so source-health rows and export lines now preserve explicit state labels across:


  - `loaded`


  - `empty`


  - `stale`


  - `degraded`


  - `unavailable`


  - `disabled`


- extended `marineContextSourceSummary` metadata/export lines with explicit unavailable counting and state-bearing row lines


- tightened `marineContextIssueQueue` wording so degraded/unavailable issues are described as source-health/context limitations rather than anomaly severity


- updated deterministic marine smoke fixtures to expose:


  - one degraded source-health example via `Scottish Water Overflows`


  - one unavailable source-health example via `France Vigicrues Hydrometry`


- added marine smoke assertions that confirm degraded/unavailable state visibility in:


  - source-specific cards


  - marine context source summary


  - marine context issue queue


  - exported `marineAnomalySummary` metadata


- updated marine docs so workflow validation now records degraded/unavailable workflow visibility and the remaining family-level limitation that CO-OPS/NDBC still do not emit `degraded`

Blockers or caveats:

- `degraded` still remains intentionally absent for NOAA CO-OPS and NOAA NDBC because the current slice has no honest partial-ingest/source-quality degradation signal there


- degraded/unavailable source health remains a context limitation only; it is not anomaly severity, vessel-behavior evidence, impact proof, or wrongdoing evidence


- no anomaly scoring changes, no severity merging across source families, and no vessel-intent / flooding / pollution / health-impact inference was added





Next recommended task:


- if Manager AI wants the next marine workflow hardening slice, add marine-local review/report phrasing tests that explicitly preserve no-severity and no-impact wording when degraded or unavailable context dominates the current source mix


## 2026-04-30 22:16 America/Chicago





Assignment version:


- 2026-04-30 21:43 America/Chicago





Task:


- add backend-supported unavailable/degraded source-health semantics for current marine context sources where those states can be represented honestly, then align docs and marine-local type contracts





What changed:


- extended marine backend source-health handling in `app/server/src/services/marine_context_service.py` so current marine context sources can now emit:


  - `unavailable` for honest source-retrieval failure across NOAA CO-OPS, NOAA NDBC, Scottish Water Overflows, France Vigicrues Hydrometry, and Ireland OPW Water Level


  - `degraded` for honest partial-metadata source-health conditions on Scottish Water Overflows, France Vigicrues Hydrometry, and Ireland OPW Water Level


- preserved existing `loaded`, `empty`, `stale`, and `disabled` behavior


- kept `degraded` intentionally unimplemented for NOAA CO-OPS and NOAA NDBC because the current slice still has no honest partial-ingest/source-quality degradation signal there


- added deterministic backend regression coverage for:


  - retrieval-failure `unavailable` behavior


  - partial-metadata `degraded` behavior where supported


  - stale thresholds remaining timestamp-based rather than fetch-time theater


- updated marine contract docs so they now distinguish:


  - states emitted by all five source families


  - states emitted only by Scottish Water, Vigicrues, and Ireland OPW


  - the remaining documented gap for CO-OPS/NDBC degraded semantics


- widened marine-local client/type unions that consume backend source-health metadata so the updated contract still lint/builds cleanly

- `python -m compileall app/server/src` -> pass


- `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint` -> pass


- `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` -> pass





Blockers or caveats:


- `degraded` is now emitted only where the backend has honest partial-metadata evidence at the source-health layer:


  - Scottish Water Overflows


  - France Vigicrues Hydrometry


  - Ireland OPW Water Level


- NOAA CO-OPS and NOAA NDBC still do not emit `degraded`; that remains intentional and documented


- `unavailable` is now emitted only for actual backend retrieval failure, not fabricated live-network theater


- no anomaly scoring changes, no severity merging across source families, and no vessel-intent / wrongdoing / impact inference was added





Next recommended task:


- if Manager AI wants the next hardening slice, add marine smoke/export assertions that distinguish `degraded` versus `unavailable` context-source states without promoting either into anomaly severity


# Marine AI Progress





## 2026-04-30 17:24 America/Chicago





Assignment version:


- 2026-04-30 16:54 America/Chicago





Task:


- build a backend/docs-first marine source-health semantics package so stale handling is honest and timestamp-based instead of purely documented





What changed:


- added a shared backend health interpretation path in `app/server/src/services/marine_context_service.py` that classifies loaded fixture responses as `stale` only when returned source observation/update timestamps exceed source-specific freshness thresholds


- preserved existing `loaded`, `empty`, and `disabled` behavior where appropriate


- implemented honest stale handling for all five current marine context families:


  - NOAA CO-OPS: stale after 30 minutes based on returned water-level/current observation timestamps


  - NOAA NDBC: stale after 45 minutes based on returned buoy/station observation timestamps


  - Scottish Water Overflows: stale after 2 hours based on returned monitor `last_updated_at`


  - France Vigicrues Hydrometry: stale after 60 minutes based on returned observation timestamps


  - Ireland OPW Water Level: stale after 60 minutes based on returned reading timestamps


- added deterministic backend regression coverage proving each family can now honestly emit `stale` from aged fixture timestamps


- updated marine contract/fixture/workflow docs so they now distinguish:


  - currently emitted states


  - timestamp-based stale support


  - states that remain documented but not emitted (`unavailable`, `degraded`)

- `python -m compileall app/server/src` -> pass





Blockers or caveats:


- `stale` is now honestly emitted only for loaded responses with old source observation/update timestamps; it is not derived from fetch-time theater


- `unavailable` still is not emitted for these marine context sources because the current fixture/live-disabled slice does not have a real endpoint/network failure path to represent it honestly


- `degraded` still is not emitted for these marine context sources because the current contracts do not yet model a real partial-ingest/source-quality state at the source-health layer


- no anomaly scoring, severity merging, source semantic blur, flood-impact, contamination, health-impact, damage, anomaly-cause, vessel-behavior, vessel-intent, or wrongdoing inference was added





Next recommended task:


- if Manager AI wants the next semantics pass, add a real backend-supported `degraded` / `unavailable` path only where a source can surface endpoint failure or partial-ingest truth without fabricating bad states


## 2026-04-30 17:08 America/Chicago





Assignment version:


- 2026-04-30 16:43 America/Chicago





Task:


- recover current-state validation for the marine context fusion and context review-report package and promote docs from pending to confirmed where the commands actually pass





What changed:


- re-ran the full marine validation stack now that Connect reported the stale shared build blocker was gone:


  - marine backend contract tests


  - backend compileall


  - client lint


  - client build


  - marine-only smoke


- confirmed that deterministic marine smoke already covered the existing fusion/review package without needing new implementation changes:


  - visible `Marine Context Fusion` card


  - visible `Marine Context Review Report` card


  - `marineAnomalySummary.contextFusionSummary`


  - `marineAnomalySummary.contextReviewReport`


- updated workflow docs from pending recheck language to current confirmed truth for fusion/review


- added a compact fusion/review validation evidence table documenting:


  - backend and metadata dependencies


  - visible helper/card dependencies


  - deterministic smoke assertions


  - export metadata keys


  - caveat boundaries





Files touched:


- `app/docs/marine-workflow-validation.md`


- `app/docs/marine-module.md`

- `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint` -> pass


- `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` -> pass


- `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py marine` -> pass





Blockers or caveats:


- no new smoke fixture wiring or marine implementation changes were needed in this pass; existing deterministic smoke coverage was already sufficient once the shared build was green again


- no anomaly scoring, severity merging, source semantic blur, flood-impact, contamination, health-impact, damage, anomaly-cause, vessel-behavior, vessel-intent, or wrongdoing inference was added


- the documented semantics gap remains:


  - deterministic fixture mode still does not honestly emit `stale` or `unavailable`


  - those states should stay documented rather than fabricated until a real source-health path exists





Next recommended task:


- wait for Manager AI to assign the next marine source/workflow slice now that the context fusion and context review-report package is freshly build- and smoke-confirmed





## 2026-04-30 16:58 America/Chicago





Assignment version:


- 2026-04-30 16:24 America/Chicago





Task:


- do a backend/docs-only workflow-hardening pass for marine context fusion and context review report validation dependencies





What changed:


- tightened backend-only regression coverage for the newer hydrology context sources so their source-health boundary matches the older marine context sources:


  - Vigicrues fixture mode now explicitly proves it does not fabricate `stale`, `error`, or `unknown`


  - Vigicrues bogus source mode now explicitly normalizes to `sourceMode=unknown` and `health=disabled`


  - Ireland OPW fixture mode now explicitly proves it does not fabricate `stale`, `error`, or `unknown`


  - Ireland OPW bogus source mode now explicitly normalizes to `sourceMode=unknown` and `health=disabled`


- updated marine workflow docs so the context fusion and context review report package now has a cleaner validation trail:


  - backend/source-summary dependencies


  - frontend helper dependencies


  - expected smoke assertions


  - export metadata keys


  - caveat and no-inference boundaries


  - explicit note that current shared-build smoke recheck remains pending Connect confirmation


- updated the source contract matrix so fusion/review are documented as downstream consumers of the existing marine context-source contracts rather than as independent backend routes


- updated the fixture reference so fusion/review expectations are explicitly described as inherited from source fixtures rather than backed by their own server fixture contracts

- `python -m compileall app/server/src` -> pass





Blockers or caveats:


- shared frontend build/lint/smoke was not rechecked in this assignment because the next-task doc scoped this pass to backend/docs-only while Connect AI handles shared frontend truth


- context fusion and context review report remain frontend-local consumers of existing marine context-source/export metadata contracts; this pass clarified that dependency chain but did not add new backend routes


- no anomaly scoring, severity merging, source semantic blur, flood-impact, contamination, health-impact, damage, anomaly-cause, vessel-behavior, vessel-intent, or wrongdoing inference was added


- the documented semantics gap remains:


  - deterministic fixture mode still does not honestly emit `stale` or `unavailable`


  - those states should stay documented rather than fabricated until a real source-health path exists





Next recommended task:


- once Connect AI confirms the shared frontend build is green again, rerun `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`, `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`, and `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py marine` to promote the context fusion and context review report package from dependency-documented to freshly smoke-confirmed

Assignment version:


- 2026-04-30 16:17 America/Chicago





Task:


- build a marine-local context review/report package on top of the existing fusion summary





What changed:


- added `app/client/src/features/marine/marineContextReviewReport.ts` to compose the existing marine context fusion and issue-queue outputs into a bounded review/report package


- the report helper now produces:


  - report title and summary line


  - context families included


  - review-needed items


  - export caveat lines


  - source-health summary


  - explicit `does not prove` lines


  - compact machine-readable metadata


- extended `marineEvidenceSummary.ts` so snapshot/export metadata now includes:


  - `marineAnomalySummary.contextReviewReport`


- added a compact `Marine Context Review Report` card to `MarineAnomalySection.tsx`


- extended marine smoke assertions for:


  - visible report card text


  - `marineAnomalySummary.contextReviewReport` metadata presence and structure

- `python -m compileall app/server/src` -> pass


- `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint` -> pass


- `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` -> fail outside marine





Blockers or caveats:


- shared frontend build is currently blocked in non-marine code:


  - `app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx(852,5): error TS2552: Cannot find name 'selectedTargetSummary'. Did you mean 'selectedDataHealthSummary'?`


- per scope, I did not modify `AppShell.tsx`


- marine smoke was not rerun after this blocker because the shared build is not green and the served bundle would not be a trustworthy validation target


- no anomaly scoring, severity merging, vessel-behavior, vessel-intent, anomaly-cause, flood-impact, contamination, health-impact, damage, pollution-impact, or wrongdoing inference was added





Next recommended task:


- wait for Connect AI to clear the shared `AppShell.tsx` build blocker, then rerun marine build/smoke to promote the context review report to build- and smoke-confirmed





## 2026-04-30 16:16 America/Chicago





Assignment version:


- 2026-04-30 16:10 America/Chicago





Task:


- build a larger marine-local context fusion/review summary across existing marine context families





What changed:


- added `app/client/src/features/marine/marineContextFusionSummary.ts` to compose the existing marine context families into one bounded review/export helper


- the fusion helper now summarizes:


  - ocean/met context from combined CO-OPS/NDBC


  - hydrology context from Vigicrues/OPW


  - infrastructure context from Scottish Water


  - existing context issue counts and top caveats


  - export readiness as a workflow qualifier only


- extended `marineEvidenceSummary.ts` so snapshot/export metadata now includes:


  - `marineAnomalySummary.contextFusionSummary`


- added a compact `Marine Context Fusion` card in `MarineAnomalySection.tsx` with:


  - overall availability line


  - export-readiness line


  - per-family review lines


  - highest-priority caveats


- extended marine-only smoke so it now explicitly validates:


  - the visible fusion card


  - the `marineAnomalySummary.contextFusionSummary` metadata block


- updated marine docs so the fusion layer and its semantic boundaries are explicit:


  - family-level composition only


  - no merged severity score


  - no flood-impact, contamination, anomaly-cause, vessel-behavior, or vessel-intent inference

- `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint` -> pass


- `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` -> pass

Blockers or caveats:


- context fusion remains a review/export helper only and does not change anomaly scoring


- ocean/met, hydrology, and infrastructure context remain semantically separate and are not collapsed into a generic severity signal


- export readiness here means context completeness/caveat posture only, not confidence in vessel conclusions


- no flood-impact, inundation, contamination, health-impact, damage, anomaly-cause, vessel-behavior, or vessel-intent inference was added





Next recommended task:


- wait for Manager AI to assign the next marine federation or source-expansion slice now that family-level context fusion is build- and smoke-confirmed





## 2026-04-30 16:06 America/Chicago





Assignment version:


- 2026-04-30 15:24 America/Chicago





Task:


- add a bounded marine hydrology context review/export summary that composes Vigicrues and Ireland OPW without creating a severity model





What changed:


- added `app/client/src/features/marine/marineHydrologyContext.ts` to compose already-loaded Vigicrues and Ireland OPW summaries into:


  - a compact hydrology source line


  - per-source review lines


  - compact export lines


  - compact metadata and caveats


- extended the per-source frontend helpers so the composed summary can preserve:


  - fixture/live mode


  - source health


  - nearby station counts


  - top observed time when present


  - partial-metadata flags


- extended `marineEvidenceSummary.ts` so snapshot/export metadata now includes:


  - `marineAnomalySummary.hydrologyContext`


- added a compact `Marine Hydrology Context` card in the marine section so the composed review helper is visible in the same marine-local context pattern as the existing source cards


- extended marine-only smoke so the workflow now explicitly validates:


  - the composed hydrology card


  - the composed hydrology export metadata block


- updated marine docs so the hydrology composition layer is explicit and still bounded:


  - no flood-impact, anomaly-cause, vessel-behavior, or vessel-intent inference


  - no merged Vigicrues/OPW severity model

- no flooding, inundation, damage, contamination, health-impact, anomaly-cause, vessel-behavior, or vessel-intent inference was added


- deterministic fixture mode still does not fabricate `stale` or `unavailable` health states





Next recommended task:

## 2026-04-30 16:41 America/Chicago





Assignment version:


- 2026-04-30 15:11 America/Chicago





Task:


- promote `ireland-opw-waterlevel` from build-confirmed to marine-smoke-covered





What changed:


- extended the marine-only Playwright smoke phase with narrow Ireland OPW assertions for:


  - card visibility


  - source-summary row presence


  - `marineAnomalySummary.irelandOpwWaterLevelContext` export metadata presence


- tightened the existing context-source summary smoke assertion from four source rows to five so Ireland OPW is now part of the registry/export validation path


- added the missing deterministic `/api/marine/context/ireland-opw-waterlevel` endpoint to the marine smoke fixture app so the smoke path validates a real fixture-backed OPW card instead of an incomplete harness


- updated marine workflow docs and contract-matrix wording so Ireland OPW now truthfully reads as marine-smoke-covered


- kept the smoke-harness edit narrow:


  - one new fixture endpoint in `smoke_fixture_app.py`


  - one new visible-card assertion


  - one new export metadata assertion block


  - one registry-label/count expansion

- no flood-impact, inundation, damage, contamination, health-impact, anomaly-cause, vessel-behavior, or vessel-intent inference was added


- OPW remains separate from marine anomaly evidence and does not affect scoring


- the deterministic fixture smoke path still does not fabricate `stale` or `unavailable` source-health states

Task:


- add the first marine-local client consumption slice for `ireland-opw-waterlevel`





What changed:


- added typed client API coverage for the Ireland OPW water-level backend contract


- added `useMarineIrelandOpwWaterLevelContextQuery(...)` in the shared marine query file with a narrow isolated change


- added `marineIrelandOpwContext.ts` to build compact marine-local source summary lines, station lines, export lines, and metadata


- added a compact marine-local `Ireland OPW Water Level` card to the existing marine context workflow in `MarineAnomalySection.tsx`


- extended `marineEvidenceSummary.ts` so export/snapshot metadata now includes:


  - `marineAnomalySummary.irelandOpwWaterLevelContext`


- extended the marine context source registry so Ireland OPW now appears as:


  - source label `Ireland OPW Water Level`


  - category `hydrology`


  - observed evidence basis


- extended the marine context issue queue so Ireland OPW partial-metadata caveats can surface as source-health/context issues


- updated marine docs so they now reflect frontend card and export metadata coverage for OPW while keeping smoke status separate

Blockers or caveats:


- OPW remains hydrology context only and is separate from marine anomaly evidence


- the new UI is compact and marine-local, not final product polish


- OPW is frontend-consumed and export-covered in this slice, but not yet workflow-smoke-covered


- no flooding, inundation, damage, contamination, health-impact, anomaly-cause, vessel-behavior, or vessel-intent inference was added


- provisional-data caveats remain explicit and reading time remains distinct from fetch/publication context





Next recommended task:


- wait for Manager AI to assign either OPW smoke-promotion or the next marine context source/workflow slice


## 2026-04-30 16:09 America/Chicago





Assignment version:


- 2026-04-30 14:29 America/Chicago





Task:


- implement the first fixture-first backend slice for `ireland-opw-waterlevel`





What changed:


- added a backend-only Ireland OPW water-level marine context slice at:


  - `GET /api/marine/context/ireland-opw-waterlevel`


- pinned the exact official endpoint family for this first slice:


  - `https://waterlevel.ie/geojson/latest/`


  - `https://waterlevel.ie/geojson/`


- added marine-only settings for:


  - source mode


  - fixture path


  - latest GeoJSON URL


  - GeoJSON metadata URL


  - timeout


- added typed backend contracts for:


  - source health


  - station metadata


  - latest water-level reading


  - context response


- added deterministic fixture coverage for:


  - one River Feale station


  - one River Blackwater station


  - one partial-metadata station with missing `waterbody`


  - empty/no-match behavior


  - disabled non-fixture behavior


- preserved export-ready provenance fields through:


  - `stationSourceUrl`


  - `latestReading.sourceUrl`


  - `readingAt`


- updated marine docs and contract/fixture references to record the new backend-only source and its caveats

Validation:


- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_ireland_opw_waterlevel.py -q` -> pass


- `python -m compileall app/server/src` -> pass





Blockers or caveats:


- OPW remains backend-only in this slice and is not yet frontend-consumed or smoke-covered


- readings remain provisional hydrometric context only


- no flooding, inundation, damage, contamination, health-impact, anomaly-cause, vessel-behavior, or vessel-intent inference was added


- current deterministic fixture mode honestly emits `loaded`, `empty`, or `disabled`; it does not fabricate `stale` or `unavailable`





Next recommended task:


- wait for Manager AI to assign either the first OPW frontend consumption slice or the next backend marine context source


## 2026-04-30 15:42 America/Chicago





Assignment version:


- 2026-04-30 14:16 America/Chicago





Task:


- promote France Vigicrues Hydrometry from build-confirmed to marine-smoke-covered in the marine workflow





What changed:


- extended the marine-only Playwright smoke phase with narrow Vigicrues assertions for:


  - card visibility


  - source-summary row presence


  - `marineAnomalySummary.vigicruesHydrometryContext` export metadata presence


- tightened the existing context-source summary smoke assertion from three source rows to four so Vigicrues is now part of the registry/export validation path


- added the missing deterministic `/api/marine/context/vigicrues-hydrometry` endpoint to the marine smoke fixture app so the new smoke assertions validate a real fixture-backed card instead of a stale/unimplemented harness gap


- updated marine workflow docs and contract-matrix wording so Vigicrues now truthfully reads as marine-smoke-covered


- kept the smoke-harness edit narrow:


  - one new fixture endpoint in `smoke_fixture_app.py`


  - one new visible-card assertion


  - one new export metadata assertion block


  - one registry-label/count expansion





Files touched:


- `app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs`


- `app/server/tests/smoke_fixture_app.py`


- `app/docs/marine-workflow-validation.md`


- `app/docs/marine-context-source-contract-matrix.md`


- `app/docs/marine-module.md`


- `app/docs/agent-progress/marine-ai.md`





Validation:


- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_vigicrues_hydrometry.py -q` -> pass


- `python -m compileall app/server/src` -> pass


- `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint` -> pass


- `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` -> pass


- `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py marine` -> pass





Blockers or caveats:


- Vigicrues remains contextual river-condition data only


- water height and flow remain separate observation families and are not collapsed into one severity/anomaly concept


- no flood-impact, inundation, damage, pollution-impact, health-impact, or vessel-behavior inference was added


- the deterministic fixture smoke path still does not fabricate `stale` or `unavailable` source-health states





Next recommended task:


- wait for Manager AI to assign the next marine source/workflow slice now that Vigicrues is workflow-smoke-confirmed


## 2026-04-30 15:04 America/Chicago





Task:


- add the first marine-local client consumption slice for France Vigicrues hydrometry





What changed:


- added client API types for the Vigicrues hydrometry backend contract


- added `useMarineVigicruesHydrometryContextQuery(...)` in the shared marine query file with a small isolated change


- added `marineVigicruesContext.ts` to build compact marine-local source summary lines, station lines, export lines, and metadata


- added a minimal marine-local `France Vigicrues Hydrometry` card to the existing marine context workflow in `MarineAnomalySection.tsx`


- extended `marineEvidenceSummary.ts` so export/snapshot metadata now includes:


  - `marineAnomalySummary.vigicruesHydrometryContext`


- extended the marine context source registry so Vigicrues now appears as:


  - source label `France Vigicrues Hydrometry`


  - category `hydrology`


  - observed evidence basis


- extended the marine context issue queue so Vigicrues partial-metadata caveats can surface as source-health/context issues


- updated marine docs so they no longer claim Vigicrues has no frontend card or export metadata block

- `app/docs/marine-context-source-contract-matrix.md`





Validation:


- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_vigicrues_hydrometry.py -q` -> pass


- `python -m compileall app/server/src` -> pass


- `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint` -> pass


- `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` -> pass





Blockers or caveats:


- Vigicrues remains separate from the combined CO-OPS/NDBC environmental context helper in this slice to avoid semantic blurring


- the new Vigicrues UI is compact and marine-local, not final product polish


- no flood-impact, inundation, damage, pollution-impact, health-impact, vessel-behavior, or vessel-intent inference was added


- water height and flow remain separate and are not collapsed into a single severity or anomaly concept


- workflow docs now reflect frontend card/export metadata coverage, but marine smoke was not extended in this task





Next recommended task:


- extend marine-only smoke for Vigicrues card/export metadata once Manager or Connect asks for workflow-validation promotion of this source beyond backend/frontend build confidence





## 2026-04-30 14:12 America/Chicago





Task:


- implement a narrow fixture-first backend slice for France Vigicrues / Hub'Eau hydrometry





What changed:


- pinned the official public Hub'Eau hydrometry endpoint family for this first slice:


  - `https://hubeau.eaufrance.fr/api/v2/hydrometrie/referentiel/stations`


  - `https://hubeau.eaufrance.fr/api/v2/hydrometrie/referentiel/sites`


  - `https://hubeau.eaufrance.fr/api/v2/hydrometrie/observations_tr`


- added marine-only backend settings for Vigicrues hydrometry mode, fixture path, pinned URLs, and timeout


- added typed marine API contracts for Vigicrues source health, station metadata, latest observation, and context response


- added a fixture-first marine backend service and route:


  - `GET /api/marine/context/vigicrues-hydrometry`


- preserved explicit `observed` evidence basis, source mode, source health, observed timestamps, units, caveats, and export-ready provenance fields


- preserved strict separation between water-height and flow through both contract fields and route parameter filtering


- added a dedicated backend test file for:


  - loaded contract behavior


  - empty/no-match behavior


  - water-height vs flow filtering


  - partial metadata coverage


  - disabled non-fixture behavior


  - request validation for radius/coordinates/parameter


- updated marine backend docs to record:


  - the exact pinned endpoint family


  - current backend-only scope


  - backend contract coverage status


  - fixture scenarios and no-flood-impact caveats

- `python -m compileall app/server/src` -> pass


- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_marine_contracts.py -q` -> pass





Blockers or caveats:


- current Vigicrues slice is backend-only and fixture-first; there is no frontend card or smoke coverage yet


- current deterministic fixture mode honestly emits `loaded`, `empty`, or `disabled`; it does not fabricate `stale` or `unavailable`


- hydrometry station values remain context only and must not be used as flood-impact confirmation, inundation truth, damage assessment, pollution inference, health-risk evidence, or vessel-behavior evidence





Next recommended task:


- add a backend-only marine export/context metadata helper contract for Vigicrues or wait for Manager/Connect to assign the first marine-local client consumption slice once shared frontend work is green





## 2026-04-30 13:35 America/Chicago





Task:


- add bounded backend-only contract coverage for stale/unavailable source-health behavior in marine context sources





What changed:


- added backend tests to lock down the current source-health boundary for NOAA CO-OPS, NOAA NDBC, and Scottish Water Overflows


- confirmed that fixture mode currently emits only `loaded` or `empty` for these context sources


- confirmed that non-fixture / unimplemented modes emit `disabled`, with `sourceMode` staying `live` or `unknown` as appropriate


- explicitly prevented regression toward fabricated `stale`, `error`, or `unavailable` fixture states without real backend support


- documented the remaining semantics gap in:


  - `app/docs/marine-context-source-contract-matrix.md`


  - `app/docs/marine-context-fixture-reference.md`


  - `app/docs/marine-workflow-validation.md`





Files touched:


- `app/server/tests/test_marine_contracts.py`


- `app/docs/marine-context-source-contract-matrix.md`


- `app/docs/marine-context-fixture-reference.md`


- `app/docs/marine-workflow-validation.md`





Validation:


- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_marine_contracts.py -q` -> pass


- `python -m compileall app/server/src` -> pass





Blockers or caveats:


- current deterministic context services do not honestly emit `stale` or `unavailable`


- that remains a documented semantics gap rather than something âfixedâ with fabricated fixture behavior


- backend-only change; no frontend/shared files touched


- no source semantics, anomaly scoring, or vessel-intent inference changed





## 2026-04-30 13:19 America/Chicago





Task:


- add a backend-only fixture reference for marine context sources and harden fixture-shape regression coverage





What changed:


- created `app/docs/marine-context-fixture-reference.md`


- documented fixture mode behavior, representative records, empty/no-match behavior, missing optional fields, source health, source mode, evidence basis, caveats, disabled behavior, and regression protections for NOAA CO-OPS, NOAA NDBC, and Scottish Water Overflows


- added `test_context_source_fixtures_cover_representative_record_shapes` to lock down representative source record coverage


- hardened the marine test client helper to reset marine source modes to deterministic fixture defaults for each test run


- added reference links from the marine module and marine workflow validation docs to the new fixture guide





Files touched:


- `app/docs/marine-context-fixture-reference.md`


- `app/server/tests/test_marine_contracts.py`


- `app/docs/marine-module.md`


- `app/docs/marine-workflow-validation.md`





Validation:


- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_marine_contracts.py -q` -> pass


- `python -m compileall app/server/src` -> pass





Blockers or caveats:


- backend-only change; no frontend build, lint, or smoke coverage was run


- no source semantics, anomaly scoring, or vessel-behavior inference changed





Next recommended task:


- extend marine source-health validation for stale or unavailable source behavior without broadening semantics or touching shared frontend files

# Data AI Progress

## 2026-05-05 23:58 America/Chicago

Assignment version read:
- `2026-05-05 23:58 America/Chicago`

Task:
- finish the current bounded Data AI slice cleanly and write the Phase 3 handoff packet

Status:
- completed

What changed:
- did not open any new source family or fresh source-build lane
- treated the just-finished bounded institutional wave as the completed checkpoint and stopped there cleanly
- wrote the Phase 3 handoff packet in `app/docs/phase3-handoffs/data-ai.md`
- made the handoff explicit about:
  - implemented backend feed, review, and context surfaces
  - implemented client reporting-helper surfaces
  - source-health and evidence-basis posture
  - reporting-helper and export-helper relevance for incoming Phase 3 work
  - the difference between implemented and workflow-validated
  - the most important guardrails for Platform AI and Connect AI
- appended this assignment-closeout entry and updated the alert ledger for reassignment visibility

Current truths recorded for the next lane:
- the current Data AI checkpoint is fully finished at a coherent stop point
- Data AI now consists of three main implemented surface groups:
  - shared feed aggregation plus family review surfaces
  - endpoint-style cyber or internet or institutional context slices
  - metadata-only client reporting helpers inside `dataAiSourceIntelligence`
- the Data AI reporting stack is implemented and regression-covered, but remains `workflow-supporting-evidence-only`
- evidence-basis and source-health posture must remain explicit and separate from any truth, severity, or action layer

Validation:
- `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json`

Notes:
- this was a docs-only finish-up and handoff checkpoint, so I used the narrowest honest validation set
- no staging, commit, or push was performed

## 2026-05-05 20:22 America/Chicago

Assignment version read:
- `2026-05-05 20:22 America/Chicago`

Task:
- implement one bounded official institutional source wave centered on `SEC EDGAR` and `USAspending`

Status:
- completed

What changed:
- added a new fixture-first SEC EDGAR company context route at `GET /api/context/institutional/sec-edgar/company`
- pinned the SEC submissions endpoint pattern to `https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK##########.json`
- kept the SEC slice bounded to issuer metadata plus recent filing metadata only:
  - `cik`
  - issuer name
  - tickers
  - exchanges
  - SIC and SIC description
  - EIN
  - description
  - investor website
  - fiscal year end
  - state of incorporation and phone
  - mailing and business addresses
  - bounded recent filing rows with form, accession number, filing date, report date, primary document, primary document description, and item text as inert source data
  - source health and request or export metadata
- added a new fixture-first USAspending recipient context route at `GET /api/context/institutional/usaspending/recipient`
- pinned the USAspending recipient endpoint pattern to `https://api.usaspending.gov/api/v2/recipient/<HASH_VALUE>/`
- kept the USAspending slice bounded to recipient-level institutional context only:
  - recipient hash
  - recipient name
  - UEI
  - DUNS
  - recipient type and business types
  - parent recipient name
  - location summary
  - total obligation, outlay, and award counts
  - top agency summaries with agency ids, names, obligation totals, outlay totals, and award counts
  - source health and request or export metadata
- wired both institutional routes into the backend app and added new response contracts in `app/server/src/types/api.py`
- added deterministic fixtures:
  - `app/server/data/sec_edgar_submissions_fixture.json`
  - `app/server/data/usaspending_recipient_fixture.json`
- added focused tests:
  - `app/server/tests/test_sec_edgar.py`
  - `app/server/tests/test_usaspending.py`
- updated source docs and repo-truth tracking:
  - `app/docs/cyber-context-sources.md`
  - `app/docs/source-validation-status.md`
  - `app/docs/source-assignment-board.md`

Guardrails preserved:
- no live-network tests, browser-only flows, private URLs, credentials, HTML scraping fallback, or raw filing-body extraction
- SEC filing descriptions, item text, and USAspending action-like text stay inert source data only
- no wrongdoing verdicts, fraud conclusions, lobbying conclusions, incident claims, severity scoring, urgency scoring, or action mandates
- no person-tracking workflow, officer dossiers, or full contact-card harvesting
- institutional context remains bounded official source-reported metadata only, not legal proof or required-action guidance

Validation:
- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_sec_edgar.py app/server/tests/test_usaspending.py -q`
- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_sec_edgar.py app/server/tests/test_usaspending.py app/server/tests/test_data_ai_multi_feed.py app/server/tests/test_rss_feed_service.py -q`
- `python -m compileall app/server/src`
- `cmd /c npm.cmd run test:data-ai-source-intelligence`
- `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`
- `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`
- `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json`

Notes:
- one unrelated one-line client cleanup in `app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceHazardContextConsumerPacket.ts` was required to clear the current lint gate; it removed an unused import and did not change Data AI source behavior
- no staging, commit, or push was performed

  - issuer CA id
  - issuer name
  - common name
  - logged DNS names
  - entry timestamp
  - not-before and not-after timestamps
  - serial number
  - source health and request/export metadata
- extended the existing `GET /api/context/cyber/cve-context` helper to include KEV references when the local catalog matches the queried CVE
- added deterministic fixtures:
  - `app/server/data/cisa_kev_catalog_fixture.json`
  - `app/server/data/rdap_bootstrap/dns.json`

Guardrails preserved:
- no browser-only ingestion, linked-page extraction, raw HTML scraping fallback, private URLs, tokenized feeds, credentials, or live-network tests
- no scoring, no corroboration score, no threat verdicts, no attribution claims, and no action mandates were added
- RDAP intentionally avoids full contact-card exposure and does not create person-tracking workflows
- crt.sh and RDAP text stays inert and does not alter repo or agent behavior
- KEV inclusion, RDAP registration data, and certificate-transparency records remain source-reported or contextual evidence only

Task:
- build one bounded Data AI question briefing packet over the existing reporting stack

Status:
- completed

What changed:
- added a pure `buildDataAiQuestionBriefingPacket` helper in `app/client/src/features/inspector/dataAiSourceIntelligence.ts`
- the helper builds only on the current Data AI metadata-only reporting path:
  - topic-scoped report packet
  - workflow-evidence snapshot

  - topic-safe report export packet
- the helper packages one bounded question briefing packet for the active topic/report path, including:
  - active topic, timeframe, and filter posture
  - source-family coverage by evidence class
  - source ids, modes, health, and freshness posture
  - lineage across topic packet, workflow snapshot, current-awareness digest, coherence summary, and export packet
  - open review gaps and unanswered-question lines
  - export-safe briefing lines
  - explicit caveats and does-not-prove posture
- threaded the new packet into the existing Data AI report surface in `app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx` as a compact `Question Briefing Packet` subsection under the current `Topic-Safe Report Export Packet`
- extended `app/client/scripts/dataAiSourceIntelligenceRegression.mjs` to cover:

  - preserved lineage across topic/report/workflow/digest/coherence/export helpers
  - preserved unanswered-question posture
  - URL-free export lines
  - no hostile-text leakage
  - no scoring or corroboration drift

Guardrails preserved:
- no new feed family, no new backend route, and no new large panel were added
- the packet reuses existing topic/report/workflow/export metadata only and does not reopen Source Discovery, long-tail candidate intake, reviewed-claim lineage, Stack Exchange, seed packets, archive breadth, Statuspage, Mastodon, or platform-root discovery as truth or source-promotion surfaces
- the question briefing packet remains metadata-only and does not create article-truth promotion, workflow-validation proof, corroboration scoring, trust weighting, severity scoring, or required-action guidance
- duplicate counts do not become corroboration, and media or commentary coverage does not become field truth, impact proof, wrongdoing proof, intent proof, attribution proof, legal status, urgency, remediation priority, or required action

Task:
- build one bounded topic-scoped Data AI report packet over the existing metadata-only family, topic, fusion, and report surfaces

Status:
- completed

What changed:
- added a pure `buildDataAiTopicReportPacket` helper in `app/client/src/features/inspector/dataAiSourceIntelligence.ts`
- the new helper builds only on existing Data AI metadata-only surfaces:
  - recent-items metadata
  - readiness/export snapshot
  - family review
  - review queue
  - topic/context lens
  - fusion / claim-integrity snapshot
  - report-brief package
- the helper supports explicit topic selection with `topicId` and otherwise falls back to the first active topic from the existing topic lens
- the packet preserves:
  - active topic label and filter posture
  - source-family coverage by evidence class
  - source ids, source modes, and source health posture
  - metadata-only recent evidence lines built from source ids, source category, evidence basis, source health, and published timestamp only
  - dedupe and corroboration posture
  - review and export-readiness gaps
  - `observe`, `orient`, `prioritize`, and `explain`
  - explicit does-not-prove lines
- threaded the new packet into the existing Data AI report surface in `app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx` as a compact `Topic Report Packet` subsection under the current `Report Brief Package`
- extended `app/client/scripts/dataAiSourceIntelligenceRegression.mjs` to cover:
  - default topic selection from the active topic lens
  - explicit world-news topic selection
  - deterministic section ordering
  - URL-free export lines
  - inert metadata-only recent evidence lines
  - no scoring drift
  - corroboration and does-not-prove guardrails
- updated the Data AI docs so the topic packet is recorded as existing metadata-only workflow support rather than a new feed family or truth-weighting surface

Guardrails preserved:
- no new feed family, no new backend route, and no fresh panel were added
- the packet uses existing family/topic/fusion/report surfaces only and does not reopen Source Discovery, long-tail candidate intake, reviewed-claim lineage, Statuspage/Mastodon discovery, or platform-root discovery as truth or source-promotion surfaces
- metadata-only recent evidence lines do not include article bodies, linked-page URLs, raw feed dumps, titles, or summaries
- duplicate volume does not become independent corroboration, and media or commentary coverage does not become field truth, impact proof, wrongdoing proof, intent proof, attribution proof, legal status, urgency, remediation priority, or required action
- no headline-based severity scoring or action guidance was added

## 2026-05-05 09:47 America/Chicago

Assignment version read:
- `2026-05-05 09:47 America/Chicago`

Task:
- add one bounded `world-news-awareness` family on the existing Data AI feed stack and thread it through the current review, source-intelligence, fusion, and report surfaces

Status:
- completed

What changed:
- added one bounded `world-news-awareness` family to the existing Data AI aggregate registry in `app/server/src/services/data_ai_feed_registry.py`
- the exact validated source ids and feed URLs used are:
  - `bbc-world` -> `https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml`
  - `guardian-world` -> `https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss`
  - `aljazeera-all` -> `https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml`
  - `dw-all` -> `https://rss.dw.com/rdf/rss-en-all`
  - `france24-en` -> `https://www.france24.com/en/rss`
  - `npr-world` -> `https://feeds.npr.org/1004/rss.xml`
- added six deterministic feed fixtures under `app/server/data/data_ai_multi_feeds` with prompt-injection-like, quote-heavy, attribution-heavy, editorial, and HTML-bearing text that stays inert
- extended `app/server/tests/test_data_ai_multi_feed.py` so the shared recent-items route, family overview, readiness/export snapshot, and family review continue to preserve:
  - contextual-only evidence basis
  - media-awareness caveats
  - HTML/script stripping in normalized summaries
  - metadata-only export behavior
  - family and source counts after the six-source expansion
- updated the client topic/fusion/report helper path in `app/client/src/features/inspector/dataAiSourceIntelligence.ts` with a bounded `world-news` metadata-only topic so the new family is visible in the existing source-intelligence stack without creating a new panel
- extended `app/client/scripts/dataAiSourceIntelligenceRegression.mjs` so the existing metadata-only client consumer explicitly exercises the `world-news-awareness` family end to end

Guardrails preserved:
- the work stayed on the existing `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/recent` route and existing `overview`, `readiness-export`, `review`, source-intelligence, fusion, and report surfaces only
- media reporting remains contextual awareness only, not primary event truth, field confirmation, impact certainty, attribution proof, legal certainty, or required-action guidance
- quoted, attribution-heavy, imperative-looking, and editorially framed feed text remains inert and cannot change source health, evidence basis, validation state, routing, or repo behavior
- no live-network tests, crawling, linked-page fetching, article-body extraction, broad multi-family expansion, staging, commit, or push were added

## 2026-05-04 23:26 America/Chicago

Assignment version read:
- `2026-05-04 23:26 America/Chicago`

Task:
- build one bounded Data AI report-brief helper on top of the existing metadata-only fusion / claim-integrity snapshot and related source-intelligence surfaces

Status:
- completed

What changed:
- added a pure `buildDataAiReportBriefSummary` helper in `app/client/src/features/inspector/dataAiSourceIntelligence.ts`
- the new helper builds directly on the existing Data AI metadata-only stack instead of adding feeds, backend routes, or Source Discovery backend mechanics:
  - source intelligence
  - readiness/export
  - family review
  - review queue
  - topic/context lens
  - scoped infrastructure/status context
  - long-tail intake posture
  - fusion / claim-integrity snapshot
- the report-brief helper produces deterministic report-ready sections only:
  - `observe`
  - `orient`
  - `prioritize`
  - `explain`
- extended `app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx` so the existing Data AI Source Intelligence card now includes a compact `Report Brief Package` subsection and no new large panel
- extended `app/client/scripts/dataAiSourceIntelligenceRegression.mjs` to assert deterministic section order, report-ready section lines, URL-free export lines, no hostile-text leakage, and no scoring drift

Report-brief package behavior:
- `observe` preserves source families, active filters, source mode, and current source-health posture
- `orient` preserves evidence-basis posture, methodology posture, corroboration posture, and candidate-vs-validated posture
- `prioritize` preserves review counts, readiness gaps, prompt-injection posture, attention posture, and scoped infrastructure/status attention context
- `explain` preserves caveats, does-not-prove language, and export-safe summary lines
- all lines remain metadata-only and export-safe; no article bodies, linked-page URLs, quoted snippets, raw feed dumps, or free-form source text are surfaced

Guardrails preserved:
- no new feeds were added and no implemented feed families were reopened
- no Source Discovery structure-scan, candidate intake, knowledge-backfill, or review-claim lineage mechanics were duplicated inside Data AI
- prompt-injection-like source text remains inert and cannot change routing, health, validation state, or app behavior
- duplicate-heavy or repeated coverage does not become independent corroboration, truth weighting, severity, threat, attribution, legal, remediation, or action scoring
- methodology-bound provider or measurement language does not become outage truth or whole-internet truth
- the package remains workflow-supporting metadata only and does not prove exploitation, compromise, incident impact, attribution, legal status, urgency, remediation priority, outage truth, or required action

## 2026-05-04 22:59 America/Chicago

Assignment version read:
- `2026-05-04 22:59 America/Chicago`

Task:
- build one bounded Data AI fusion-snapshot or claim-integrity helper over the existing metadata-only family review, readiness/export, topic/context, infrastructure/status, and long-tail posture surfaces

Status:
- completed

What changed:
- added a pure `buildDataAiFusionSnapshotSummary` helper in `app/client/src/features/inspector/dataAiSourceIntelligence.ts`
- the new helper composes the already implemented metadata-only Data AI surfaces instead of adding a new backend route or duplicating Source Discovery backend behavior:
  - source intelligence
  - family review
  - readiness/export
  - topic/context lens
  - scoped infrastructure/status context
  - long-tail intake posture
- extended `DataAiSourceIntelligenceSummary` to preserve selected family ids and selected source ids so the new fusion package can carry filter posture forward explicitly
- extended `app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx` so the existing Data AI Source Intelligence card now includes a compact `Fusion / Claim Integrity Snapshot` subsection and no new large panel
- extended `app/client/scripts/dataAiSourceIntelligenceRegression.mjs` to assert family/source filter preservation, active topic posture, infrastructure-source preservation, corroboration posture, candidate-vs-validated posture, methodology caveats, does-not-prove language, URL-free export lines, and no scoring drift

Fusion / claim-integrity package behavior:
- preserves family ids and source ids from the existing readiness/export surface
- preserves source mode, family/source health posture, prompt-injection posture, review/readiness counts, export-readiness gaps, and active topic/context posture
- carries infrastructure methodology caveats forward from the scoped `cloudflare-radar`, `netblocks`, and `apnic-blog` package
- carries long-tail candidate-vs-validated, provenance, duplicate-cluster, and `as_detailed_in_addition_to`-style relationship semantics forward as metadata-only posture
- emits export-safe lines only; no article bodies, linked-page URLs, raw feed dumps, quoted snippets, or free-form source text are surfaced

Guardrails preserved:
- no feed families were reopened and no new feeds were added
- no Source Discovery structure-scan, candidate intake, knowledge-backfill, or review-claim lineage mechanics were rebuilt inside Data AI
- prompt-injection-like source text remains inert and cannot change routing, health, validation state, or app behavior
- duplicate-heavy or repeated coverage does not become independent corroboration, truth weighting, severity, threat, attribution, legal, remediation, or action scoring
- methodology-bound provider or measurement language does not become outage truth or whole-internet truth
- the package remains workflow-supporting metadata only and does not prove exploitation, compromise, incident impact, legal status, attribution, urgency, remediation priority, outage truth, or required action

- `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json` -> pass

Blockers or caveats:
- this remains contract-tested and workflow-supporting only; no smoke/manual workflow validation was added
- the required client build is currently blocked by unrelated in-progress work in `AppShell.tsx`, not by the Data AI fusion/claim-integrity helper
- no live-network tests, browser automation, new feeds, broad crawling, linked-page fetching, article-body extraction, staging, commits, or pushes were added

## 2026-05-04 22:01 America/Chicago

Assignment version read:
- `2026-05-04 22:01 America/Chicago`

Task:
- add the next Atlas-approved public cyber/internet RSS/Atom feed batch plus a bounded metadata-only long-tail intake/dedupe posture package on the existing Data AI surfaces

Status:
- completed

What changed:
- added six new public no-auth cyber/internet feed sources to the existing Data AI aggregate registry:
  - `trailofbits-blog` -> `https://blog.trailofbits.com/index.xml`
  - `mozilla-hacks` -> `https://hacks.mozilla.org/feed/`
  - `chromium-blog` -> `https://blog.chromium.org/feeds/posts/default`
  - `webdev-google` -> `https://web.dev/static/blog/feed.xml`
  - `gitlab-releases` -> `https://about.gitlab.com/releases.xml`
  - `github-changelog` -> `https://github.blog/changelog/feed/`
- grouped those six sources under the new bounded family `cyber-internet-platform-watch` in `app/server/src/services/data_ai_feed_registry.py`
- added fixture-first coverage for all six feeds under `app/server/data/data_ai_multi_feeds` with prompt-injection-like, release-like, guidance-like, and operational-looking text that stays inert
- extended `app/server/tests/test_data_ai_multi_feed.py` so the new family appears in recent-items, family overview, readiness/export, family review, and review-queue-adjacent guardrail coverage with updated counts and export-safe assertions
- extended `app/client/src/features/inspector/dataAiSourceIntelligence.ts` with a pure `buildDataAiLongTailDiscoverySummary` helper and updated the topic lens so the new family is grouped under the bounded cyber topic
- extended `app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx` so the existing Data AI Source Intelligence card now includes a metadata-only `Long-Tail Intake Posture` subsection built from current readiness/review/review-queue metadata only
- extended `app/client/scripts/dataAiSourceIntelligenceRegression.mjs` to assert the new long-tail helper preserves candidate-vs-validated, provenance, duplicate-cluster, and `as_detailed_in_addition_to`-style related-coverage semantics without URL leakage or crawling drift

New feed behavior and safety:
- all six sources remain `contextual` evidence only
- release notes, changelogs, browser guidance, research notes, and platform updates remain untrusted source text and do not become exploit proof, incident confirmation, standards compliance truth, or required-action guidance
- normalized recent items preserve source id, source name, source category, feed URL, item timestamps, source mode, source health, evidence basis, caveats, tags, and export-safe metadata
- prompt-injection-like text remains inert, HTML/script/code markup is stripped from normalized summaries, and export-safe lines stay metadata-only and URL-free
- dedupe posture remains source-scoped on the aggregate route; the new long-tail helper explicitly keeps duplicate-cluster, supporting-source-count, independent-source-count, and related-coverage semantics as future metadata posture only rather than live crawling or source promotion

Long-tail intake/dedupe posture:
- candidate discoveries remain candidate/review only until separate implementation and validation evidence exists
- provenance posture stays explicit: family ids, source ids, source mode, source health, evidence basis, caveats, and dedupe posture remain visible
- duplicate volume must not masquerade as independent corroboration
- `as_detailed_in_addition_to`-style related coverage remains metadata-only linkage, not truth, severity, attribution, or action evidence
- no broad crawling, linked-page fetching, or article-body extraction was added

Skipped candidates:
- none; six clean repo-local approved cyber/internet candidates were available and implemented within the assignment cap

## 2026-05-04 21:43 America/Chicago

Assignment version read:
- `2026-05-04 21:43 America/Chicago`

Task:
- add a metadata-only internet infrastructure/status context package over the already implemented `cloudflare-radar`, `netblocks`, and `apnic-blog` family

What changed:
- extended `app/client/src/features/inspector/dataAiSourceIntelligence.ts` with a pure `buildDataAiInfrastructureStatusContextSummary` helper plus stable infrastructure-family constants
- extended `app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx` so the existing Data AI Source Intelligence card now includes a bounded Infrastructure/Status Context subsection built from filtered readiness/export, review, review-queue, and recent-item metadata over `family=infrastructure-status` and `source=cloudflare-radar,netblocks,apnic-blog`
- extended `app/client/scripts/dataAiSourceIntelligenceRegression.mjs` with scoped infrastructure/status fixture data and assertions for active filters, methodology caveats, prompt-injection inertness, no URL leakage, no whole-internet truth drift, no operator-confirmed outage drift, and no scoring language
- updated `app/docs/cyber-context-sources.md`, `app/docs/data-ai-feed-rollout-ladder.md`, and `app/docs/data-ai-next-routing-after-family-summary.md` to document the new metadata-only infrastructure/status package
- updated `app/docs/source-validation-status.md` and `app/docs/source-assignment-board.md` so repo truth now reflects a stable metadata-only infrastructure/status consumer path while staying below workflow-validated

Infrastructure/status context package behavior:
- uses only existing backend metadata surfaces and scoped filters; it does not reopen ingestion or add new feeds
- preserves source ids, source mode, source health, evidence bases, methodology caveats, recent-item counts, dedupe posture, prompt-injection posture, export-readiness gaps, active filters, and export-safe lines
- keeps `cloudflare-radar`, `netblocks`, and `apnic-blog` explicitly methodology-bound and contextual only
- renders metadata-only summaries and export-safe lines without surfacing linked-page URLs, raw feed text, article bodies, or free-form recent-item text

Prompt-injection, no-leakage, methodology, dedupe, and scoring guardrails:
- hostile or instruction-like infrastructure/status item text stays inert and does not change source health, grouping, validation state, routing, or app behavior
- provider analysis is not converted into whole-internet truth, operator-confirmed outage truth, severity, threat, incident, attribution, legal, remediation, or action scoring
- methodology caveats remain explicit for provider-specific analysis, measurement-dependent reporting, and routing/policy context
- dedupe posture remains source-scoped and export-safe lines remain URL-free metadata summaries only

Blockers or caveats:
- this remains contract-tested and workflow-supporting only; no smoke/manual workflow validation was added
- no new feed sources, live-network tests, broad polling, linked-page fetching, article-body extraction, staging, commits, or pushes were added
- the prior `2026-05-02 15:45 America/Chicago` report-snapshot backfill remains unresolved because it cannot be reconstructed safely from repo-local evidence alone

## 2026-05-04 21:17 America/Chicago

Assignment version read:
- `2026-05-04 21:17 America/Chicago`

Task:
- reconcile the already-implemented official cyber advisory family with current source-status truth and explicit metadata-only consumer coverage

What changed:
- confirmed the repo already contained the bounded official cyber advisory family implementation for `ncsc-uk-all`, `cert-fr-alerts`, and `cert-fr-advisories` in the shared Data AI registry, fixtures, tests, and docs, so I did not duplicate the source build
- strengthened the focused Data AI regression in `app/client/scripts/dataAiSourceIntelligenceRegression.mjs` so the current metadata-only consumer path explicitly covers `ncsc-uk-all`, `cert-fr-alerts`, and `cert-fr-advisories`
- updated `app/docs/source-validation-status.md` to reflect current repo truth: these implemented Data AI waves and helpers now have a stable metadata-only consumer path, but still remain below workflow-validated because no smoke/manual workflow evidence exists
- updated `app/docs/source-assignment-board.md` to reflect the current Data AI source-intelligence plus topic/context lens posture

Official family semantics confirmed:
- `ncsc-uk-all`
  - official NCSC UK mixed guidance/advisory/news context
  - evidence basis remains `contextual`
  - feed text remains untrusted and does not prove exploitation, victimization, incident confirmation, attribution, impact, or required action
- `cert-fr-alerts`
  - official CERT-FR security alert context in French
  - evidence basis remains `advisory`
  - feed text remains untrusted and does not prove exploitation, compromise, victim impact, attribution, or required action
- `cert-fr-advisories`
  - official CERT-FR advisory context in French
  - evidence basis remains `advisory`
  - feed text remains untrusted and does not create urgency proof, incident certainty, or cross-source severity claims

Prompt-injection, no-leakage, dedupe, and export guardrails:
- recent-item, family-review, readiness/export, and topic/context lens behavior remains metadata-only workflow support
- the strengthened regression proves hostile advisory titles/summaries for NCSC UK and CERT-FR stay inert and do not change source health, grouping, validation state, routing, or app behavior
- no linked-page URLs, article-body extraction, raw feed dumps, scoring, truth verdicts, or action recommendations were added
- dedupe posture remains source-scoped and export-safe lines remain URL-free metadata summaries only

Prior assignment backfill status:
- the referenced `2026-05-02 15:45 America/Chicago` Data AI report-snapshot final report could not be reliably reconstructed from repo-local evidence without inventing history, so it remains unbackfilled pending Manager clarification

Docs updated:
- `app/docs/source-validation-status.md`
- `app/docs/source-assignment-board.md`
- `app/docs/agent-progress/data-ai.md`

- `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint` -> pass
- `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` -> pass
- `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json` -> pass

Blockers or caveats:
- no new source families were added in this slice because the official cyber advisory family was already present in the current worktree
- this remains contract-tested and workflow-supporting only; no smoke/manual workflow validation was added
- no live-network tests, broad polling, linked-page fetching, article-body extraction, staging, commits, or pushes were added

## 2026-05-02 12:40 America/Chicago

Assignment version read:
- `2026-05-02 12:27 America/Chicago`

Task:
- add a bounded Data AI topic/context lens and export package over existing recent-item and family-review metadata

What changed:
- added client contracts for Data AI recent items/source-health metadata in `app/client/src/types/api.ts`
- added a recent-items query helper in `app/client/src/lib/queries.ts` for `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/recent`
- extended `app/client/src/features/inspector/dataAiSourceIntelligence.ts` with a pure metadata-only topic/context lens
- added a compact topic/context lens block inside the existing inspector Data AI Source Intelligence card in `app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx`
- extended `app/client/scripts/dataAiSourceIntelligenceRegression.mjs` so the focused regression now covers both the source-intelligence posture summary and the topic/context lens

Topic/context lens behavior:
- topic hints are bounded and explicit: `cyber`, `infrastructure`, `public-institution`, `investigation-civic`, `governance-standards`, `advisory`, and `science-environment`
- grouping uses only existing metadata: family ids, source ids, source categories, tags, evidence bases, source health, source modes, caveat classes, and dedupe posture
- recent items are counted into topics by existing family/source metadata and bounded metadata hints only; there is no article-body, title, or summary inference
- the inspector lens emits compact export-safe topic lines with family/source counts, recent-item counts, review-issue counts, evidence bases, caveat classes, and source-health posture

Prompt-injection, no-leakage, and no-scoring guardrails:
- the topic lens does not render article bodies, raw feed dumps, hostile titles, free-form summaries, linked-page content, or linked-page URLs
- topic export lines are filtered to remain metadata-only and URL-free
- prompt-injection-like recent-item text stays inert and cannot change topic grouping rules, source health, evidence basis, validation posture, or repo behavior
- no credibility, truth, severity, threat, incident, exploitation, compromise, attribution, legal, remediation, policy, or action scores were added
- the workflow-validation state remains explicit: this is workflow-supporting evidence only, not workflow-validated evidence

## 2026-05-02 11:56 America/Chicago

Assignment version read:
- `2026-05-02 11:49 America/Chicago`

Task:
- add a client-light Data AI Source Intelligence consumer on top of the existing metadata-only backend readiness/export, family review, and review queue surfaces

What changed:
- added typed client contracts for Data AI readiness/export, family review, and review queue responses in `app/client/src/types/api.ts`
- added query helpers in `app/client/src/lib/queries.ts` for `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/readiness-export`, `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/review`, and `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/review-queue`
- added a pure summary builder in `app/client/src/features/inspector/dataAiSourceIntelligence.ts` that composes the existing backend surfaces into one metadata-only operational summary
- added a small always-visible Data AI Source Intelligence card to the inspector in `app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx`
- added a focused regression script, `app/client/scripts/dataAiSourceIntelligenceRegression.mjs`, plus the `npm` script `test:data-ai-source-intelligence`

Client workflow behavior:
- the inspector card is client-light and reads only the existing backend review surfaces; no new backend feed family or connector path was created
- it shows review queue counts, top issue kinds, source mode, family/source health posture, evidence-basis summary, caveat-class summary, prompt-injection coverage posture, export-readiness gap count, and compact export-safe lines
- it renders even with no selected map target so it can support review workflow state independently of entity inspection

Prompt-injection, no-leakage, and no-scoring guardrails:
- the client summary stays metadata-only and does not render article bodies, linked pages, raw feed dumps, or linked-page URLs
- compact export lines are filtered to drop URL-bearing lines before rendering
- the summary preserves backend guardrails and does not create credibility, truth, severity, threat, incident, exploitation, compromise, attribution, legal, remediation, policy, or action scores
- the workflow-validation state is explicit: this consumer is workflow-supporting evidence only and is not workflow-validated because no smoke or manual workflow proof was recorded

## 2026-05-02 10:55 America/Chicago

Assignment version read:
- `2026-05-02 10:47 America/Chicago`

Task:
- add a backend-only Data AI cross-family review queue and export bundle for family/source review coverage, source-health issues, caveat classes, dedupe posture, and prompt-injection test posture

What changed:
- added a new metadata-only backend route, `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/review-queue`, without creating another ingestion framework
- added a new queue service, `app/server/src/services/data_ai_source_family_review_queue_service.py`, that composes the existing family overview and family/source summary data rather than reopening feed ingestion
- extended the typed API contract with queue metadata and queue issue models so the queue preserves family/source ids, source mode, source health, evidence bases, caveat classes, counts, timestamps, review lines, export-safe lines, and active filters
- preserved the current aggregate/review/readiness surfaces and built the queue on top of them instead of adding a second registry path

Review queue and export bundle behavior:
- `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/review-queue` supports bounded `family=`, `source=`, `category=`, and `issue_kind=` filters
- queue categories are `family` and `source`
- current queue issue kinds are:
  - `fixture-local-source`
  - `empty-family`
  - `empty-source`
  - `degraded-source`
  - `high-caveat-density`
  - `duplicate-heavy-feed`
  - `prompt-injection-coverage-present`
  - `prompt-injection-coverage-missing`
  - `export-readiness-gap`
  - `contextual-only-caveat-reminder`
  - `advisory-only-caveat-reminder`
- family-level items can flag fixture-local posture, empty-family state, duplicate-heavy families, prompt-injection fixture posture, export-readiness posture, and contextual-only or advisory-only reminders
- source-level items can flag fixture-local posture, empty sources, degraded/error/disabled/stale/unknown source states, high caveat density, and duplicate-heavy feeds
- the export bundle remains metadata-only: top-level export lines and per-issue export lines summarize ids, health, mode, evidence, caveat classes, counts, and filters without copying free-form feed text or linked-page URLs

Prompt-injection, no-leakage, and no-scoring guardrails:
- queue lines, export lines, and review lines remain metadata-only and do not echo hostile free-form feed text, linked-page URLs, or article-body content
- tests prove imperative and quoted source text stays inert in the queue just as it does in aggregate/review/readiness routes
- no scoring layer was added: no credibility score, truth score, severity score, threat score, incident proof, exploitation proof, compromise proof, attribution proof, legal conclusion, remediation priority, policy recommendation, or required-action guidance
- source-health, caveat, evidence-basis, prompt-injection posture, and dedupe-posture fields remain explicit and preserved in the queue output

## 2026-05-02 10:45 America/Chicago

Assignment version read:
- `2026-05-02 10:34 America/Chicago`

Task:
- implement the bounded `investigative-civic-context` feed-family expansion using the existing aggregate, family overview, readiness/export snapshot, and family review surfaces

What changed:
- expanded the shared `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/recent` aggregate registry instead of creating another feed system
- added these exact documented no-auth sources and fixture-backed feed URLs:
  - `propublica` -> `https://www.propublica.org/feeds/propublica/main`
  - `global-voices` -> `https://globalvoices.org/feed/`
- added the new bounded family definition, `investigative-civic-context`, to the shared family overview, shared readiness/export snapshot, and shared family review surface without changing runtime exposure or adding a new connector path
- preserved source ids, labels, family/category, feed URLs, source mode, source health, evidence basis, caveats, raw/deduped counts, dedupe posture, tags, review lines, and export-safe lines

Aggregate, overview, readiness/export, and review behavior:
- `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/recent` now includes the two new investigative/civic sources and supports bounded `source=propublica,global-voices`
- the `propublica` fixture intentionally carries a duplicate-story/update pattern, so family and aggregate counts now preserve `3` raw items collapsing to `2` deduped items for that bounded source slice
- `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/overview` now includes `investigative-civic-context` and preserves bounded `family=` and `source=` filter intersection
- `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/readiness-export` now includes the new family in all-family snapshots and filtered export/readiness subsets
- `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/review` now includes the new family in coverage review, caveat-class review, prompt-injection posture, dedupe posture, and export-readiness review
- no scoring layer was added: no credibility score, truth score, severity score, wrongdoing score, threat score, event proof, attribution proof, legal conclusion, or required-action guidance

Prompt-injection and caveat handling:
- added deterministic fixtures with duplicate-story/update behavior, quoted text, advocacy/normative wording, HTML-bearing text, and prompt-injection-like text
- tests prove that hostile text stays inert source data only, HTML markup such as `<strong>` and `<blockquote>` is stripped from normalized summaries, and review/export lines remain metadata-only without linked-page URLs or article-body extraction
- caveat boundaries stay explicit:
  - ProPublica remains investigative and civic-accountability reporting context, not official event confirmation, wrongdoing proof, intent proof, legal conclusion, or required-action guidance
  - Global Voices remains civic, translation, and advocacy-adjacent reporting context, not official event truth, impact proof, legal conclusion, or required-action guidance

Task:
- implement the bounded `cyber-institutional-watch-context` feed-family expansion plus a compact backend review surface for Data AI feed-family coverage

What changed:
- expanded the shared `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/recent` aggregate registry instead of creating another feed system
- added these exact documented no-auth sources and fixture-backed feed URLs:
  - `cisa-news` -> `https://www.cisa.gov/news.xml`

  - `mozilla-security-blog` -> `https://blog.mozilla.org/security/feed/`
  - `github-security-blog` -> `https://github.blog/security/feed/`
- added the new bounded family definition, `cyber-institutional-watch-context`, to the shared family overview and shared readiness/export snapshot without changing runtime exposure or adding a new connector path
- added a compact backend review surface at `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/review` via `app/server/src/services/data_ai_source_family_review_service.py`
- preserved source ids, labels, family/category, feed URLs, source mode, source health, evidence basis, caveats, raw/deduped counts, dedupe posture, tags, and export-safe lines

Aggregate, overview, readiness/export, and review behavior:
- `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/recent` now includes the seven new cyber institutional watch sources and supports bounded `source=cisa-news,jvn-en-new,debian-security,microsoft-security-blog,cisco-talos-blog,mozilla-security-blog,github-security-blog`
- `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/overview` now includes `cyber-institutional-watch-context` and preserves bounded `family=` and `source=` filter intersection
- `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/readiness-export` now includes the new family in all-family snapshots and filtered export/readiness subsets
- `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/review` now summarizes implemented family coverage with source count, health posture, caveat classes, evidence bases, prompt-injection test posture, dedupe posture, export readiness, and compact review lines
- the new review surface reuses the existing overview/readiness data and does not create another ingestion framework
- no scoring layer was added: no credibility score, truth score, severity score, incident proof, exploitation proof, compromise proof, attribution proof, remediation priority, legal conclusion, policy recommendation, or required-action guidance

Held or rejected candidates considered for this wave:
- `cert-eu-news` held because the repo-local candidate docs record failed validation for the candidate feed URL
- `enisa-news-rss` rejected/held because the repo-local candidate docs state ENISA discontinued RSS after its site relaunch
- `jpcert-en-rss` held because the repo-local candidate docs say the English candidate failed and needs a separate endpoint-pinning pass

- `ietf-blog` held because the repo-local candidate docs record failed validation for the candidate feed URL
- `icann-announcements` held because the repo-local candidate docs record failed validation for the candidate feed URL

Prompt-injection and caveat handling:
- added deterministic fixtures with advisory wording, operational language, official-sounding claims, CVE/security wording, and prompt-injection-like text
- tests prove that hostile text stays inert source data only, script/code markup is stripped from normalized summaries, and readiness/review/export lines remain metadata-only without linked-page URLs or free-form item text
- caveat boundaries stay explicit:
  - CISA news remains official institutional/cybersecurity announcement context, not exploit proof, compromise proof, incident confirmation, or required-action guidance
  - JVN vulnerability notes remain official advisory context, not exploit proof, compromise proof, or universal remediation priority
  - Debian security advisories remain distribution advisory context, not exploit proof, incident confirmation, or universal urgency guidance

- Preserved source ids, labels, family/category, feed URLs, source mode, source health, evidence basis, caveats, raw/deduped counts, dedupe posture, tags, and export-safe lines.

Aggregate, overview, and readiness/export behavior:
- `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/recent` now includes the five new governance/standards/context sources and supports bounded `source=ripe-labs,internet-society,lacnic-news,w3c-news,letsencrypt`.
- `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/overview` now includes `internet-governance-standards-context` and preserves bounded `family=` and `source=` filter intersection.
- `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/readiness-export` now includes the new family in all-family snapshots and filtered export/readiness subsets.
- No scoring layer was added: no internet health score, outage proof, policy truth score, standards compliance conclusion, credibility score, severity score, attribution proof, legal conclusion, or required-action guidance.

Prompt-injection and caveat handling:
- Added deterministic fixtures with policy-like, standards-like, governance-recommendation, and operational-looking text plus prompt-injection-like wording.
- Tests prove that hostile text stays inert source data only, script/code markup is stripped from normalized summaries, and export lines remain metadata-only.
- Caveat boundaries stay explicit:
  - RIPE Labs remains internet measurement, policy, and operations research context, not whole-internet truth, outage proof, or required-action guidance
  - Internet Society remains internet-governance and resilience context, not policy truth, standards compliance proof, or required-action guidance
  - LACNIC News remains regional internet-registry policy and operations context, not outage proof, standards compliance proof, or required-action guidance
  - W3C News remains web-standards and governance context, not universal standards compliance proof, policy truth, or required-action guidance
  - Let's Encrypt remains certificate and internet-operations context, not universal internet-health proof, standards compliance proof, or required-action guidance

## 2026-05-02 09:42 America/Chicago

Task:
- Add a compact backend Data AI feed-family readiness/export snapshot across all implemented feed families for future analyst/report consumers.

Assignment version read:
- `2026-05-02 09:12 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- Added a new backend route, `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/readiness-export`, on top of the existing Data AI aggregate registry and family-summary machinery.
- Kept the implementation bounded to the already implemented Data AI feed families; no new family expansion was added.
- Preserved compact readiness/export snapshot metadata for all selected families and sources:
  - family ids and source ids
  - family count and source count
  - source mode and source health
  - evidence bases
  - raw item count and deduped item count
  - dedupe posture
  - guardrail line
  - caveats
  - top-level export-safe lines plus family/source export lines

Readiness/export snapshot behavior:
- The new route summarizes all implemented Data AI families by default and supports the same bounded `family=` and `source=` filtering pattern already used by the family overview route.
- `family=` and `source=` intersect cleanly, so future analyst/report consumers can request a compact snapshot for a subset such as official/public plus cyber vendor/community sources only.
- The snapshot reuses the existing family/source summary objects instead of creating a second feed framework or any scoring model.
- No scoring or truth-adjudication layer was added: no credibility score, truth score, severity score, threat score, attribution proof, incident proof, legal conclusion, or required-action guidance.

Prompt-injection and export guardrails:
- Readiness/export lines summarize only source-safe metadata and never include free-form item text, article URLs, or linked-page content.
- Tests prove that hostile feed text stays inert, does not appear in readiness/export lines, and does not alter source mode, source health, evidence basis, validation state, or repo behavior.
- The same guardrail line remains explicit: source-availability and context accounting only, not credibility scoring, event proof, attribution proof, impact proof, legal conclusion, or required action.

## 2026-05-01 15:55 America/Chicago

Task:
- Implement the next bounded Data AI source family for cyber vendor/community follow-on sources using the existing aggregate registry and family overview.

Assignment version read:
- `2026-05-01 15:44 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- Completed the shared `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/recent` aggregate contract for the already-declared `cyber-vendor-community-follow-on` family instead of creating another feed framework.
- Preserved these exact approved no-auth source definitions and fixture-backed feed URLs:
  - `google-security-blog` -> `https://security.googleblog.com/feeds/posts/default`
  - `bleepingcomputer` -> `https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/feed/`
  - `krebs-on-security` -> `https://krebsonsecurity.com/feed/`
  - `securityweek` -> `https://www.securityweek.com/feed/`
  - `dfrlab` -> `https://dfrlab.org/feed/`
- Brought tests, docs, and overview expectations into sync with the five-source family and the expanded 43-source registry state.
- Preserved the existing aggregate and family-overview metadata surfaces: source ids, labels, family/category, safe feed URLs, source mode, source health, evidence basis, raw/deduped counts, dedupe posture, tags, caveats, and export-safe lines.

Family overview behavior:
- `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/overview` now includes `cyber-vendor-community-follow-on` alongside the already implemented families.
- `family=` and `source=` filtering still intersect cleanly, including bounded subsets such as `source=google-security-blog,securityweek`.
- The new family remains metadata-only in exports and keeps free-form feed text out of family export lines.
- No scoring or adjudication layer was added: no credibility score, severity score, threat score, truth verdict, incident-proof promotion, attribution proof, legal conclusion, or required-action guidance.

Prompt-injection and caveat handling:
- Deterministic fixtures cover vendor, media, and research/disinformation-monitoring text with sensational, imperative, exploit-like, quoted-attack, and prompt-injection-like wording.
- Tests prove that hostile text stays inert source data only, script/code markup is stripped from normalized summaries, and the new family text does not alter source mode, source health, evidence basis, validation state, or repo behavior.
- Caveat boundaries stay explicit:
  - Google Security Blog remains vendor security update/research context, not independent incident confirmation, exploitation proof, or required-action guidance
  - BleepingComputer remains cyber-news context, not direct incident confirmation, compromise proof, or required-action guidance
  - Krebs on Security remains investigative cyber-reporting context, not direct incident confirmation, attribution proof, or required-action guidance
  - SecurityWeek remains cyber-industry news context, not incident confirmation, exploitation proof, or required-action guidance
  - DFRLab remains research/disinformation-monitoring context, not direct incident confirmation, attribution proof, or required-action guidance

## 2026-05-01 15:12 America/Chicago

Task:
- Implement the next bounded Data AI source family for policy/think-tank commentary using the existing aggregate registry and family overview.

Assignment version read:
- `2026-05-01 15:03 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- Expanded the shared `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/recent` registry rather than creating another feed framework.
- Added these exact approved no-auth source definitions and fixture-backed feed URLs:
  - `atlantic-council` -> `https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/feed/`

  - `modern-war-institute` -> `https://mwi.westpoint.edu/feed/`
  - `irregular-warfare` -> `https://irregularwarfare.org/feed/`
- Added a new bounded family definition, `policy-thinktank-commentary`, on the shared family overview route without changing the already implemented advisory, scientific/environmental, or other contextual families.
- Preserved the existing aggregate and family-overview contracts: source ids, labels, family/category, safe feed URLs, source mode, source health, evidence basis, raw/deduped counts, dedupe posture, tags, caveats, and export-safe lines.

Family overview behavior:
- `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/overview` now includes `policy-thinktank-commentary` alongside the existing Data AI families.
- `family=` and `source=` filtering still intersect cleanly, so callers can request only the policy/think-tank family or a bounded subset of its sources.
- Family export lines remain metadata-only and continue to exclude free-form feed text.
- No scoring layer was added: no credibility score, policy truth score, geopolitical severity score, attribution score, intent score, legal conclusion, escalation prediction, threat rating, or required-action guidance.

Prompt-injection and caveat handling:
- Added deterministic RSS fixtures for all five new sources with prescriptive policy language, scenario-style wording, operational-looking recommendations, and prompt-injection-like text.
- Tests prove that hostile text stays inert source data only, script/code markup is stripped from normalized summaries, and the new feed text does not alter source mode, source health, evidence basis, validation state, or repo behavior.
- Caveat boundaries stay explicit:
  - Atlantic Council remains policy/strategy commentary context, not event confirmation, intent proof, or required-action guidance
  - ECFR remains policy-analysis context, not event confirmation, geopolitical truth, escalation prediction, or required-action guidance
  - War on the Rocks remains strategy/security commentary context, not event confirmation, threat rating, or operational recommendation

- Family export lines remain metadata-only and continue to exclude free-form feed text.
- No scoring layer was added: no scientific certainty score, climate-impact score, health-risk conclusion, attribution score, legal conclusion, severity score, or required-action guidance.

Prompt-injection and caveat handling:
- Added deterministic Atom/RSS fixtures for all five new sources with research-style, policy-style, hazard-style, and recommendation-style text that tries to force conclusions or action.
- Tests prove that hostile text stays inert source data only, script/code markup is stripped from normalized summaries, and the new feed text does not alter source mode, source health, evidence basis, validation state, or repo behavior.

## 2026-05-01 13:49 America/Chicago

Task:
- Implement the next bounded Data AI source family for official/public advisories beyond cyber using the existing aggregate registry and family overview.

Assignment version read:
- `2026-05-01 13:24 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- Expanded the shared `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/recent` registry rather than creating another feed framework.
- Added these exact approved no-auth source definitions and fixture-backed feed URLs:
  - `state-travel-advisories` -> `https://travel.state.gov/_res/rss/TAsTWs.xml`

  - `un-press-releases` -> `https://press.un.org/en/rss.xml`
  - `unaids-news` -> `https://www.unaids.org/en/rss.xml`
- Added a new bounded family definition, `official-public-advisories`, on the shared family overview route without changing the existing `official-advisories` cyber family.
- Preserved the existing aggregate and family-overview contracts: source ids, labels, family/category, safe feed URLs, source mode, source health, evidence basis, raw/deduped counts, dedupe posture, tags, caveats, and export-safe lines.

Family overview behavior:
- `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/overview` now includes `official-public-advisories` alongside the existing Data AI families.
- `family=` and `source=` filtering still intersect cleanly, so callers can request only the official/public family or a bounded subset of its sources.
- Family export lines remain metadata-only and continue to exclude free-form feed text.
- No scoring layer was added: no credibility, severity, truth, attribution, campaign, legal, impact, or required-action score.

Prompt-injection and caveat handling:
- Added deterministic RSS fixtures for all four new sources with directive-style advisory or press text that tries to force policy, legal, field-truth, or health conclusions.
- Tests prove that hostile text stays inert source data only, script/code markup is stripped from normalized summaries, and the new feed text does not alter source mode, source health, evidence basis, validation state, or repo behavior.

## 2026-05-01 13:17 America/Chicago

Task:
- Add a backend-first Data AI feed-family export/status summary across implemented feed families without introducing a global credibility, truth, severity, attribution, or action score.

Assignment version read:
- `2026-05-01 13:04 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- Added a new backend overview route, `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/source-families/overview`, on the existing Data AI feed surface rather than creating a parallel framework.
- Refactored the shared Data AI feed service so both `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/recent` and the new family overview reuse the same per-source snapshot path for fixture parsing, source health, counts, caveats, and dedupe behavior.
- Added typed overview contracts in `app/server/src/types/api.py` for overview metadata, family summaries, and per-source family members.
- Added stable Data AI family definitions in the registry for:
  - `official-advisories`
  - `cyber-community-context`
  - `infrastructure-status`
  - `osint-investigations`
  - `rights-civic-digital-policy`
  - `fact-checking-disinformation`
  - `world-events-disaster-alerts`
- The overview now preserves, per family and per source, source ids, source labels, source categories, safe configured feed URLs, source mode, source health, evidence basis, raw/deduped item counts, dedupe posture, tags, caveats, and export-safe lines.
- Added a separate `guardrailLine` stating that the summary is source-availability/context accounting only, not credibility scoring, event proof, attribution proof, impact proof, legal conclusion, or required action.

Filtering and export behavior:
- Added bounded `family=` filtering and kept bounded `source=` filtering on the overview route.
- `family=` and `source=` intersect cleanly, so callers can request a narrow subset without reopening the full feed bundle.
- Family export lines intentionally summarize metadata only; they do not copy free-form feed titles or summaries into the export surface.
- Dedupe posture is explicit and conservative: per-source dedupe by guid, canonical link, or sanitized content fingerprint only, with no cross-source claim fusion or global truth merge.

Prompt-injection and caveat handling:
- Added deterministic overview tests proving family export lines do not surface hostile source text like `ignore previous instructions`, quoted imperative wording, or script markup.
- The new overview preserves the same source-health/evidence/caveat boundaries already enforced by the item-level route.
- No global credibility score, severity score, truth score, attribution score, legal conclusion, or action recommendation was added anywhere in the overview contract.

Covered and excluded:
- Covered:
  - all currently implemented Data AI feed families listed above
- Excluded intentionally:
  - live-network verification
  - linked-page scraping
  - article extraction

## 2026-05-01 12:54 America/Chicago

Task:
- Implement the next large Data AI source bundle for fact-checking/disinformation context feeds inside the existing aggregate feed framework.

Assignment version read:
- `2026-05-01 12:45 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- Expanded the shared `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/recent` aggregate bundle by adding five fact-checking/disinformation source definitions to the existing registry rather than creating a parallel feed framework.
- Added these exact source definitions and fixture-backed feed URLs:
  - `full-fact` -> `https://fullfact.org/feed/`
  - `snopes` -> `https://www.snopes.com/feed/`
  - `politifact` -> `https://www.politifact.com/rss/all/`
  - `factcheck-org` -> `https://www.factcheck.org/feed/`
  - `euvsdisinfo` -> `https://euvsdisinfo.eu/feed/`
- Preserved the same aggregate/export contract for the new sources: source id, source name, source category, feed URL, final URL, guid/link, title, summary, published/updated timestamps, fetched timestamp, evidence basis, source mode, source health, caveats, and tags.
- Reused the existing bounded `source` filtering path so callers can request the fact-checking/disinformation family without polling every configured feed, for example with `source=full-fact,snopes,politifact,factcheck-org,euvsdisinfo`.
- Added deterministic fixtures for claim-review, misinformation-review, claim-rating, fact-checking, and disinformation-monitoring text without expanding into linked-page scraping or live-network tests.

Prompt-injection coverage:
- Added instruction-like text in `full_fact.xml` that tries to turn a claim review into universal truth.
- Added imperative plus script-bearing text in `snopes.xml`.
- Added quoted directive-like text in `politifact.xml`.
- Added enforcement-like text in `factcheck_org.xml`.
- Added truth/adjudication and action-like text in `euvsdisinfo.xml`.
- Focused tests prove this text stayed inert source data only: normalized summaries preserve the text, strip markup like `<script>`, and do not alter source health, evidence basis, validation state, or repo behavior.

CVE-context behavior:
- No new CVE-context behavior was added.
- None of the new fact-checking/disinformation fixtures introduced a CVE string, so the existing explainability-only CVE context path remained unchanged.

Files touched:
- `app/server/src/services/data_ai_feed_registry.py`
- `app/server/data/data_ai_multi_feeds/full_fact.xml`

Semantics preserved:
- Evidence basis remains `contextual`.
- Source mode and source health continue through the shared aggregate route.
- Export metadata remains feed URL, final URL, guid/link, title, summary, timestamps, evidence basis, source mode, source health, caveats, and tags.
- The source family remains contextual fact-checking/disinformation monitoring, not universal truth adjudication, legal proof, attribution proof, platform policy, or required-action guidance.

Blockers or caveats:
- Preserved caveat boundaries against exploit/compromise/outage-scope/impact/attribution/legal/action/severity overclaiming: these feeds discuss claims, misinformation, fact checks, or monitoring context and must not be promoted to universal truth, legal conclusion, attribution proof, or required-action guidance.
- No secrets, tokenized feeds, live-network tests, article scraping, linked-page scraping, broad polling, or runtime exposure changes were added.
- No blocker requires Connect AI or Manager AI routing beyond routine reassignment after this completed task.
- Updated `app/docs/agent-progress/data-ai.md`; awaiting Manager AI reassignment.

## 2026-05-01 12:38 America/Chicago

Task:
- Implement a bounded rights/civic/digital-policy feed bundle using the existing aggregate feed foundation.

Assignment version read:

What changed:
- Expanded the shared `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/recent` aggregate bundle by adding four rights/civic/digital-policy source definitions to the existing registry rather than creating a parallel feed framework.

- Preserved the same aggregate/export contract for the new sources: source id, source name, source category, feed URL, final URL, guid/link, title, summary, published/updated timestamps, fetched timestamp, evidence basis, source mode, source health, caveats, and tags.
- Reused the existing bounded `source` filtering path so callers can request the rights/civic family without polling every configured feed, for example with `source=eff-updates,access-now,privacy-international,freedom-house`.
- Added deterministic fixtures for civic, advocacy, privacy-rights, and democracy-rights text without expanding into linked-page scraping or live-network tests.

Prompt-injection coverage:
- Added instruction-like text in `eff_updates.xml` that tries to turn civic analysis into mandatory policy.
- Added imperative plus script-bearing text in `access_now.xml`.
- Added quoted directive-like text in `privacy_international.xml`.
- Added configuration-like text in `freedom_house.xml`.
- Focused tests prove this text stayed inert source data only: normalized summaries preserve the text, strip markup like `<script>` or `<code>`, and do not alter source health, evidence basis, validation state, or repo behavior.

What changed:
- Expanded the shared `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/recent` aggregate bundle by adding three infrastructure/status/analysis source definitions to the existing registry instead of creating a parallel feed framework.

## 2026-04-30 22:23 America/Chicago

Task:
- Implement the backend-only official cyber advisory feed expansion bundle using the existing Data AI aggregate feed foundation.

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 22:01 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- Expanded the existing `GET /api/feeds/data-ai/recent` aggregate bundle by adding three official cyber advisory source definitions to the shared registry rather than creating a parallel feed framework.
- Added these exact source definitions and fixture-backed feed URLs:
  - `ncsc-uk-all` -> `https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/api/1/services/v1/all-rss-feed.xml`
  - `cert-fr-alerts` -> `https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/alerte/feed/`
  - `cert-fr-advisories` -> `https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/avis/feed/`
- Preserved the shared aggregate contract and export surface for the new sources: source id, source name, source category, feed URL, final URL, guid/link, title, summary, published/updated timestamps, fetched timestamp, evidence basis, source mode, source health, caveats, and tags.
- Reused the existing bounded `source` filtering path so callers can query the official advisory family without polling every configured feed, for example with `source=ncsc-uk-all,cert-fr-alerts,cert-fr-advisories`.
- Added deterministic fixtures for the new official feeds with English and French advisory/guidance text, including HTML-bearing and imperative-looking content.

Prompt-injection coverage:
- Added English instruction-like fixture text in `ncsc_uk_all.xml`.
- Added French instruction-like fixture text and script markup in `cert_fr_alerts.xml`.
- Added quoted command-like text and HTML-bearing content in `cert_fr_advisories.xml`.
- Focused tests prove that the new source text stayed inert data only: summaries preserve the text, strip markup like `<script>` or `<code>`, and do not alter source health, evidence basis, validation state, or repo behavior.

CVE-context behavior:
- No new CVE-context matching framework was added.
- The existing feed-mention composition path now safely surfaces newly local official feed mentions when a normalized feed item itself contains the queried CVE id; fixture coverage now shows `cert-fr-alerts` can appear in `feedMentions` for `CVE-2021-40438` without changing the explainability-only posture.

## 2026-04-30 21:59 America/Chicago

Task:
- Implement the backend-only fixture-first `nist-nvd-cve` first slice plus a bounded cyber context composition helper.

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 21:43 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- Added a fixture-first NIST NVD CVE backend slice at `GET /api/context/cyber/nvd-cve` with bounded settings, typed API contracts, request metadata, source health, caveats, and deterministic single-CVE fixture coverage.
- Pinned the exact no-key endpoint shape used for this first slice as `https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2021-40438`, with the service building the request shape from `NVD_CVE_API_URL` plus a single `cveId` query parameter.
- Preserved bounded NVD fields: CVE id, source identifier, published/modified timestamps, vulnerability status, localized descriptions, CVSS v3.1/v3.0/v2 fields when present, weakness metadata, reference metadata, source URL, request URL, source mode, source health, evidence basis, caveats, and export metadata counts.
- Added a conservative backend composition route at `GET /api/context/cyber/cve-context` that summarizes one CVE across only already-local Data AI contexts: NVD metadata, EPSS score if present, CISA advisory references if present, and recent feed mentions if present.
- Kept the composition output explainability-only: it reports matched local contexts plus `available_contexts`, but does not invent exploit proof, compromise proof, impact proof, attribution, remediation priority, required action, or any cross-source severity score.
- Updated cyber-context docs for the new NVD route and the conservative composition route, including fixture behavior, caveats, endpoint shape, export metadata, and validation commands.

Prompt-injection coverage:
- Added prompt-injection-like text to the NVD fixture description and reference set for `CVE-2021-40438`, including imperative-looking text and script markup.
- Added focused assertions proving the hostile text stayed inert source data only: normalized descriptions retained the plain text, stripped script markup, and did not alter validation state, source health, or repo behavior.
- Preserved the same inert-text rule in the composition surface by treating all source-provided descriptions, titles, summaries, links, and references as untrusted text/data rather than instructions.

## 2026-04-30 17:05 America/Chicago

Task:
- Implement the backend-only fixture-first five-source Data AI RSS/Atom/RDF aggregate starter slice.

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 16:54 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- Added a bounded five-source feed definition registry and aggregate backend route for recent Data AI feed items across exactly these source ids: `cisa-cybersecurity-advisories`, `cisa-ics-advisories`, `sans-isc-diary`, `cloudflare-status`, and `gdacs-alerts`.
- Added the aggregate service, route, response contracts, fixture set, and per-source health/caveat normalization so items preserve source id, source name, source category, feed URL, final URL, guid/id, link, title, summary, published/updated timestamps, fetched timestamp, evidence basis, source mode, source health, caveats, and tags.
- Extended the generic feed parser foundation to accept RDF in addition to RSS and Atom, then added an RDF fixture test so the shared parser surface now covers the assigned multi-format requirement without widening the configured feed list beyond the five assigned sources.
- Added prompt-injection-like fixture coverage in free-form feed text and sanitized summaries so hostile strings and script markup remain inert source data rather than instructions.
- Updated feed/docs guidance for the new aggregate route and parser behavior.

Blockers or caveats:
- Prompt-injection fixture/check coverage was added in the SANS ISC fixture and in the RDF parser fixture path; the suspicious text stayed inert, summaries had script markup stripped, and source health/evidence basis did not change.
- Preserved source-honesty boundaries: CISA feeds remain official advisory context, SANS ISC remains community/analyst context, Cloudflare Status remains Cloudflare-only service status, and GDACS remains disaster alert context rather than impact/damage proof.
- No production secrets, tokenized feeds, private URLs, live-network tests, article scraping, all-52 polling, or runtime exposure changes were added.

Next recommended task:
- Wait for Manager AI reassignment; likely next bounded follow-up is another narrow public/no-auth source slice or a conservative multi-feed expansion that keeps source caveats distinct instead of inventing a cross-source severity score.

Task:
- Implement the first backend-only Data AI cyber-context starter bundle for `cisa-cyber-advisories` and `first-epss`.

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 16:43 America/Chicago`

What changed:
- Added a fixture-first CISA cybersecurity advisories backend slice with route, settings, contract, fixture, parser service, source health reporting, dedupe support, advisory id extraction, HTML-summary stripping, and caveat-preserving metadata/export fields.
- Added a fixture-first FIRST EPSS backend slice with route, settings, contract, fixture, CVE-query parsing, EPSS/percentile/date normalization, source health reporting, request URL/export metadata, and caveat-preserving scored-context fields.
- Added source documentation in `app/docs/cyber-context-sources.md` covering routes, fixture behavior, exact endpoints used, validation commands, and do-not-infer boundaries.
- Production code changed, but only in backend/docs-owned Data AI files.

Exact official endpoints used:
- CISA advisories feed family: `https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-advisories/cybersecurity-advisories.xml`
- FIRST EPSS API: `https://api.first.org/data/v1/epss`

Files touched:
- `app/server/src/config/settings.py`
- `app/server/src/app.py`
- `app/server/src/types/api.py`
- `app/server/src/services/cisa_cyber_advisories_service.py`
- `app/server/src/services/first_epss_service.py`
- `app/server/src/routes/cisa_cyber_advisories.py`
- `app/server/src/routes/first_epss.py`
- `app/server/data/cisa_cybersecurity_advisories_fixture.xml`
- `app/server/data/first_epss_fixture.json`
- `app/server/tests/test_cisa_cyber_advisories.py`
- `app/server/tests/test_first_epss.py`
- `app/docs/cyber-context-sources.md`
- `app/docs/agent-progress/data-ai.md`
- `app/docs/alerts.md`

Validation:
- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_cisa_cyber_advisories.py -q` -> pass
- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_first_epss.py -q` -> pass
- `python -m compileall app/server/src` -> pass
- `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json` -> pass

Blockers or caveats:
- Preserved source-honesty boundaries: CISA advisories remain advisory/source-reported context, and EPSS remains scored prioritization context rather than exploit proof, compromise proof, impact proof, attribution, or required action.
- No production secrets, tokenized feeds, private URLs, live-network tests, or runtime exposure changes were added.
- Local shell TLS fetch attempts against CISA and FIRST failed on this Windows host, so endpoint pinning relied on primary web documentation/search context rather than live terminal fetch validation.

Next recommended task:
- Wait for Manager AI reassignment; likely next bounded cyber-context slice is `nist-nvd-cve`, or a narrow fusion/lookup join that keeps CISA advisory context and EPSS scoring context semantically separate.

## 2026-04-30 16:38 America/Chicago

Task:
- Startup sync only for the new Manager-controlled Data AI lane.

Assignment version read:
- `2026-04-30 16:34 America/Chicago`

Docs read:
- `app/docs/repo-workflow.md`
- `app/docs/active-agent-worktree.md`
- `app/docs/agent-progress/README.md`
- `app/docs/agent-next-tasks/README.md`
- `app/docs/alerts.md`
- `app/docs/data-ai-onboarding.md`
- `app/docs/rss-feeds.md`
- `app/docs/source-quick-assign-packets-batch6.md`
- `app/docs/agent-next-tasks/data-ai.md`
- `app/docs/agent-progress/data-ai.md`

What changed:
- Confirmed Data AI ownership boundaries: bounded public internet-information source implementation only, with source classification/status planning left to Gather AI and repo-wide tooling blockers left to Connect AI.
- Confirmed source safety and honesty rules: public no-auth machine-readable sources only; fixture-first testing; preserve provenance, source mode, source health, evidence basis, caveats, and export metadata; do not infer exploitation, compromise, intent, impact, or causation beyond source support.
- Confirmed the existing RSS/Atom foundation already in repo: `GET /api/feeds/rss/recent`, `app/server/src/services/rss_feed_service.py`, `app/server/tests/test_rss_feed_service.py`, and `app/docs/rss-feeds.md`; feeds remain discovery/context unless the feed itself is authoritative.
- Confirmed likely future Data AI implementation candidates mentioned in current assignment context are `cisa-cyber-advisories`, `nist-nvd-cve`, and `first-epss`, but no connector was started in this startup task.
- Updated the shared startup alert state and recorded that no production code changed.

Files touched:
- `app/docs/agent-progress/data-ai.md`
- `app/docs/alerts.md`

Validation:
- docs readback only -> pass
- `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json` -> pass

Blockers or caveats:
- No implementation blocker identified during startup sync.
- Worktree remains mixed/dirty across active lanes, so no staging, commit, or push was attempted.
- Awaiting Manager AI to replace `app/docs/agent-next-tasks/data-ai.md` with the first implementation assignment.

Next recommended task:
- Wait for Manager AI assignment; first implementation should stay fixture-first and source-honest for one bounded public/no-auth source slice.

No completed Data AI tasks yet.

Startup expectation:
- Read `app/docs/data-ai-onboarding.md`.
- Read `app/docs/agent-next-tasks/data-ai.md`.
- Append a startup completion entry here after syncing.

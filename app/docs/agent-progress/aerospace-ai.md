# Aerospace AI Progress

## 2026-05-05 23:59 America/Chicago

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-05 23:58 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Finish the current aerospace slice at the smallest coherent checkpoint and write the Phase 3 Aerospace AI handoff packet without opening another source-expansion wave.
- What changed:
  Recorded the new assignment version and stopped at a coherent checkpoint because the active hazard-context consumer slice was already complete.
  Wrote the Aerospace AI Phase 3 handoff packet in [aerospace-ai.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/phase3-handoffs/aerospace-ai.md).
  The handoff documents:
  completed scope,
  current source/workflow posture,
  files and surfaces to know,
  validation already run,
  known blockers and caveats,
  what the next AI should do first,
  what not to break,
  and why the current aerospace stack matters for Spatial AI, Reporting AI, Platform AI, and Connect AI.
  The handoff explicitly preserves observed versus derived versus contextual posture, source-readiness and source-health posture, the prepared-versus-executed smoke distinction, and the no-intent / no-causation guardrails across the aerospace reporting/export stack.
- Files touched:
  [aerospace-ai.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/phase3-handoffs/aerospace-ai.md)
  [aerospace-ai.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/agent-progress/aerospace-ai.md)
- Validation:
  No new product-code validation was run in this handoff-only pass.
  The handoff references the already completed current-slice validation recorded in the previous progress entry:
  hazard-context regression passed,
  focused aerospace backend tests passed,
  compile passed,
  client lint/build passed,
  and aerospace smoke remained host-blocked before app assertions with `windows-playwright-launch-permission`.
- Blockers or caveats:
  This pass intentionally did not open another source family or another reporting/helper expansion.
  Executed aerospace browser smoke is still blocked locally by the Windows Chromium launch-permission boundary.
  Prepared smoke coverage must continue to stay separate from executed workflow evidence.
- Next recommended task:
  Incoming Phase 3 work should start from the new handoff doc, then either:
  unblock Windows Playwright launch for executed workflow evidence,
  or consume the existing bounded aerospace packets in cross-domain reporting/spatial work without weakening the explicit source-separation and no-inference guardrails.

## 2026-05-05 23:33 America/Chicago

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-05 22:17 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Build one bounded aerospace hazard-context consumer follow-on over the completed GPSJam wave and the newly landed geospatial `NWS Alerts` and `NOAA nowCOAST` surfaces, without adding a new large panel or collapsing source semantics.
- What changed:
  Recorded the assignment version for this wave and completed the bounded hazard-context consumer artifact as [aerospaceHazardContextConsumerPacket.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceHazardContextConsumerPacket.ts).
  The new packet is export/snapshot composition only and preserves explicit separation between:
  GPSJam GNSS-disruption context,
  NWS public weather advisories,
  and NOAA nowCOAST contextual map-layer metadata.
  It does not turn those feeds into aviation operational status, route-impact verdicts, outage claims, target-specific effects, safety consequences, or action recommendations.
  Client coverage was completed by adding typed `NWS Alerts` and `nowCOAST` contracts and query hooks, wiring the packet into [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx) snapshot/export metadata as `aerospaceHazardContextConsumerPacket`, and extending [aerospaceExportProfiles.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceExportProfiles.ts) so existing export profiles can prioritize the packet without adding a new UI surface.
  Deterministic smoke-fixture support was added in [smoke_fixture_app.py](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/server/tests/smoke_fixture_app.py) for `GET /api/events/nws-alerts/recent` and `GET /api/context/weather/nowcoast/layer-catalog`, and prepared aerospace smoke assertions were extended in [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) to require `aerospaceHazardContextConsumerPacket`, hazard-separation guardrails, and export-profile metadata-key coverage.
  Deterministic regression coverage was added in [aerospaceHazardContextConsumerPacketRegression.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/aerospaceHazardContextConsumerPacketRegression.mjs) and wired into [package.json](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/package.json).
  Aerospace docs were updated so this new artifact is documented as bounded hazard-context composition only and not a new source of aviation truth.

  From `app/client`, `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` passed.
  `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` failed before app assertions with `spawn EPERM`; runner diagnosis remained `windows-playwright-launch-permission` / `windows-browser-launch-permission`.
  `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json` passed and currently reports 9 open low-priority alert lines, 8 owned by Atlas AI and 1 by Manager AI.
- Blockers or caveats:
  The hazard-context consumer packet is composition-only and does not replace AWC, FAA NAS, OpenSky comparison, SWPC, VAAC, or selected-target evidence.
  GPSJam remains GNSS-disruption context only, NWS Alerts remain public weather advisories only, and NOAA nowCOAST remains contextual map-layer metadata only.
  Prepared aerospace smoke coverage now includes the hazard-context consumer packet, but executed aerospace smoke is still host-blocked by the Windows Chromium launch-permission boundary before app assertions run.
- Next recommended task:
  If Manager AI continues this hazard-context path, the next bounded aerospace step is to consume the geospatial `NHC GIS` follow-on in the same export/snapshot-only style while preserving the same advisory/reference/context separation and avoiding another large UI surface.

## 2026-05-05 22:01 America/Chicago

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-05 19:41 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Implement one bounded fresh aerospace source wave centered on GPSJam as contextual GNSS-disruption awareness only, integrated into existing aerospace export/digest/question surfaces without adding a new large panel.
- What changed:
  Recorded the assignment version for this wave and completed the GPSJam source pass.
  GPSJam was selected because it was the user-priority fresh source and fits the aerospace workflow as bounded GNSS-disruption context without replacing existing aircraft, airport, weather, or space-weather truth.
  Backend GPSJam route, fixture-first adapter/service, settings, typed contracts, and contract coverage were completed and preserved explicit no-outage/no-attribution/no-target-effect caveats.
  Client GPSJam types, query hook, and pure helper were integrated into existing aerospace export/digest/question surfaces only, preserving source id, source mode, source health, daily date posture, flagged-hex counts, top-sample summary, export-safe lines, and explicit does-not-prove lines under `gpsjamContext`.
  Deterministic regression coverage was added in [aerospaceGpsJamContextRegression.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/aerospaceGpsJamContextRegression.mjs) and wired into [package.json](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/package.json).
  Aerospace smoke-prep support was completed by adding a deterministic GPSJam smoke-fixture route and source-status entry in [smoke_fixture_app.py](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/server/tests/smoke_fixture_app.py), plus prepared metadata assertions in [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) for `gpsjamContext`, selected-target packet GNSS-awareness coverage, current-awareness digest GPSJam distinction lines, and export-profile metadata-key coverage.
  Aerospace docs were updated so GPSJam is documented as contextual GNSS-disruption awareness only and not proof of outage, jamming attribution, intent, route impact, safety consequence, or action need.

  `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` failed before app assertions with `spawn EPERM`; runner diagnosis remained `windows-playwright-launch-permission` / `windows-browser-launch-permission`.
- Blockers or caveats:
  GPSJam remains contextual GNSS-disruption awareness only.
  It does not replace AWC, FAA NAS, OpenSky comparison, SWPC, geomagnetism, VAAC, or selected-target evidence.
  It does not imply GPS outage certainty, jamming attribution, target-specific effect, route impact, safety consequence, or action recommendation.
  Prepared GPSJam smoke coverage now exists, but executed aerospace smoke is still host-blocked by the Windows Chromium launch-permission boundary before app assertions run.
- Next recommended task:
  If Manager AI continues aerospace source work, re-run the prepared aerospace smoke assertions on a Windows host where Playwright Chromium can launch, then take the next bounded fresh source from the user-priority list without adding another renamed reporting helper.

## 2026-05-05 19:31 America/Chicago

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-05 19:15 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Build one bounded aerospace question briefing packet on top of the existing aerospace reporting stack without adding a new large panel.
- What changed:
  Added the new pure helper [aerospaceQuestionBriefingPacket.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceQuestionBriefingPacket.ts).
  The packet builds on the existing aerospace reporting stack only:
  selected-target evidence summary,
  `aerospaceReportBriefPackage`,
  `aerospaceSelectedTargetOperationalQuestionPacket`,
  `aerospaceCurrentAwarenessDigest`,
  `aerospaceReportingHandoffContract`,
  `aerospaceSpaceWeatherContinuityPackage`,
  `aerospaceVaacAdvisoryReportPackage`,
  `aerospaceWorkflowEvidenceLedger`,
  and `aerospaceWorkflowValidationEvidenceSnapshot`.
  It does not add a new source and it does not add a new large panel.
  The packet preserves selected-target or area posture, active question posture, active context profile, validation and readiness posture, source ids, source modes, source health states, freshness posture, current/advisory/archive/observed distinction lines, lineage across packet/brief/digest/handoff surfaces, briefing-safe export lines, explicit caveats, and does-not-prove lines.
  Integration stayed bounded to snapshot/export surfaces only:
  [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx) now preserves `aerospaceQuestionBriefingPacket`,
  [aerospaceExportProfiles.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceExportProfiles.ts) now carries the packet metadata key and footer section,
  [aerospaceWorkflowEvidenceLedger.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceWorkflowEvidenceLedger.ts) now tracks the helper and metadata key,
  [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) now has prepared metadata assertions for the question briefing packet,
  and [aerospaceQuestionBriefingPacketRegression.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/aerospaceQuestionBriefingPacketRegression.mjs) was added as deterministic coverage.

  `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` failed before app assertions with `spawn EPERM`; diagnosis remained `windows-playwright-launch-permission` / `windows-browser-launch-permission`.
- Blockers or caveats:
  Prepared smoke coverage now includes the question briefing packet, but executed aerospace smoke is still blocked on this Windows host before browser/app assertions by the local Playwright Chromium launch permission boundary.
  The question briefing packet is a bounded reporting artifact only. It does not imply flight intent, target behavior, airport/runway availability, route impact, threat, failure, causation, safety conclusion, or action recommendation.
- Next recommended task:
  If Manager AI continues the reporting path, the next bounded step is consolidating the question briefing packet and reporting handoff contract into one stable desk-facing delivery contract while trimming duplicate footer precedence, without changing source semantics or adding a new analyst-facing surface.

## 2026-05-05 19:14 America/Chicago

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-05 19:01 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Build one bounded aerospace reporting handoff contract on top of the existing aerospace reporting stack without adding a new large panel.
- What changed:
  Added the new pure helper [aerospaceReportingHandoffContract.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceReportingHandoffContract.ts).
  The contract builds on the existing aerospace reporting stack only:
  selected-target evidence summary,
  `aerospaceReportBriefPackage`,
  `aerospaceSelectedTargetOperationalQuestionPacket`,
  `aerospaceCurrentAwarenessDigest`,
  `aerospaceSpaceWeatherContinuityPackage`,
  `aerospaceVaacAdvisoryReportPackage`,
  `aerospaceWorkflowEvidenceLedger`,
  and `aerospaceWorkflowValidationEvidenceSnapshot`.
  It does not create a new analyst-facing panel.
  It preserves selected-target or area posture, current/advisory/archive/observed distinction lines, source ids, source modes, source health states, evidence bases, validation and readiness posture, lineage across packet/brief/digest surfaces, export-safe handoff lines, explicit caveats, and does-not-prove lines.

## 2026-05-05 18:59 America/Chicago

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-05 18:44 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Build a bounded aerospace current-awareness digest on top of the existing aerospace reporting stack without adding a new large panel.
- What changed:
  Added the new pure helper [aerospaceCurrentAwarenessDigest.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceCurrentAwarenessDigest.ts).
  The digest builds on the existing aerospace reporting stack only:
  selected-target evidence summary,
  `aerospaceOperationalContext`,
  `aerospaceReportBriefPackage`,
  `aerospaceSelectedTargetOperationalQuestionPacket`,
  `aerospaceSpaceWeatherContinuityPackage`,
  `aerospaceVaacAdvisoryReportPackage`,
  `aerospaceWorkflowEvidenceLedger`,
  and `aerospaceWorkflowValidationEvidenceSnapshot`.
  It preserves current target-or-area posture, active context profile, validation posture, continuity posture, source ids, source modes, source health states, evidence bases, current/archive/advisory/observed distinction lines, observe/orient/prioritize/explain sections, caveats, and explicit does-not-prove lines.
  Integration stayed bounded to snapshot/export surfaces only:

  `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` failed before app assertions with `spawn EPERM`; runner diagnosis remained `windows-playwright-launch-permission` / `windows-browser-launch-permission`.
- Blockers or caveats:
  Prepared smoke coverage now includes the current-awareness digest, but executed aerospace smoke is still blocked on this Windows host before browser/app assertions by the local Playwright Chromium launch permission boundary.
  The digest is bounded metadata/accounting only. It does not imply flight intent, target behavior, airport/runway availability, route impact, threat, failure, causation, safety conclusion, or action recommendation.
- Next recommended task:
  If Manager AI keeps pushing the export/reporting stack, the next bounded step is to consolidate the current packet/brief/digest surfaces into one stable aerospace handoff contract and reduce redundant footer precedence rules without changing source semantics.

  2026-05-05 18:15 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Build a bounded selected-target operational question packet on top of the existing aerospace reporting stack without adding a new large panel.
- What changed:
  Added the new pure helper [aerospaceSelectedTargetOperationalQuestionPacket.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceSelectedTargetOperationalQuestionPacket.ts).
  This helper builds on the existing aerospace reporting stack only:
  selected-target evidence summary,
  `aerospaceOperationalContext`,
  `aerospaceReportBriefPackage`,
  `aerospaceSpaceWeatherContinuityPackage`,
  `aerospaceVaacAdvisoryReportPackage`,
  plus the already-loaded AWC, FAA NAS, and OpenSky comparison summaries.
  It does not add a new source and it does not add a new large panel.
  The packet preserves:
  selected-target posture,
  distinct context entries for AWC, FAA NAS, OpenSky comparison, current SWPC, NCEI archive, observed geomagnetism, and VAAC,
  source ids,
  source modes,
  source health states,
  evidence bases,
  availability/gap counts,
  bounded `observe`,
  `orient`,
  `prioritize`,
  and `explain` sections,
  caveats,
  and explicit does-not-prove lines.
  Wired the packet into [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx) as snapshot/export metadata under `aerospaceSelectedTargetOperationalQuestionPacket` and into [aerospaceExportProfiles.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceExportProfiles.ts) as a compact `selected-target-operational-question-packet` footer section plus export-profile metadata-key coverage.
  Added the focused regression [aerospaceSelectedTargetOperationalQuestionPacketRegression.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/aerospaceSelectedTargetOperationalQuestionPacketRegression.mjs) and exposed it in [package.json](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/package.json).
  Extended prepared aerospace smoke assertions in [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) so aircraft and satellite export-path checks now require `aerospaceSelectedTargetOperationalQuestionPacket`, distinct context-entry coverage, does-not-prove lines, and the question-packet guardrail.
  Updated [aerospaceWorkflowEvidenceLedger.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceWorkflowEvidenceLedger.ts), [aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md), [aerospace-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-validation.md), and [aircraft-satellite-smoke.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aircraft-satellite-smoke.md) so the packet is documented as a bounded selected-target operational-context question artifact rather than a new analyst-facing surface.

  `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json` passed and currently reports `5` open low-priority alert lines owned by Atlas AI.
- Blockers or caveats:
  Prepared smoke remains prepared smoke and is still distinct from executed workflow evidence.
  The current active blocker is still the same host-level Windows Chromium launch permission boundary before Playwright reaches app assertions.
  The new selected-target operational question packet is metadata/accounting only.
  It does not replace existing selected-target evidence, operational context, OpenSky comparison, continuity, VAAC, or report-brief helpers and does not imply flight intent, route impact, target behavior, GPS/radio/satellite failure, threat, causation, safety conclusion, or action recommendation.
- Next recommended task:
  Re-run `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` on a Windows host where Chromium launch is permitted so the prepared `aerospaceSelectedTargetOperationalQuestionPacket` assertions can move from prepared coverage to executed workflow evidence if they pass.

- Task:
  Build a bounded aerospace space-weather continuity package on top of the existing aerospace reporting stack without adding a new large panel.
- What changed:
  Added the new pure helper [aerospaceSpaceWeatherContinuityPackage.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceSpaceWeatherContinuityPackage.ts).
  This helper builds on existing aerospace reporting surfaces only:
  `aerospaceCurrentArchiveContext`,
  `geomagnetismContext`,
  and `aerospaceReportBriefPackage`.
  It does not create a new source and it does not add a new large panel.
  The package preserves:
  current SWPC advisory source ids and freshness labels,
  archival NCEI source ids and coverage labels,
  observed USGS geomagnetism source ids and timing labels,
  source modes,
  source health states,
  evidence bases,
  continuity posture,
  caveats,
  and explicit does-not-prove lines.
  Current advisory context, archive metadata, and observed geomagnetism remain explicitly distinct and the guardrails stay non-causal and non-failure-claiming.

  Extended prepared aerospace smoke assertions in [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) so aircraft and satellite export-path checks now require `aerospaceSpaceWeatherContinuityPackage`, observed evidence-basis preservation, does-not-prove lines, and the distinct-source guardrail.
  Updated [aerospaceWorkflowEvidenceLedger.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceWorkflowEvidenceLedger.ts), [aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md), [aerospace-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-validation.md), and [aircraft-satellite-smoke.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aircraft-satellite-smoke.md) so the package is documented as bounded space-weather continuity accounting rather than a new analyst-facing surface.

- Task:
  Build one bounded aerospace VAAC advisory consumer or report package on top of the existing aerospace reporting stack without adding a new large panel.
- What changed:
  Added the new pure helper [aerospaceVaacAdvisoryReportPackage.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceVaacAdvisoryReportPackage.ts).
  This helper builds on the existing aerospace VAAC context and reporting stack only:
  `vaacContext`
  plus the completed `aerospaceReportBriefPackage`.
  It does not create another review/export/timeline helper and it does not add a new large panel.
  The package preserves:
  advisory source ids,
  source mode and health,
  source state,
  evidence basis,
  advisory timestamps,
  affected-area or summary posture,
  caveats,
  and explicit does-not-prove lines.
  Washington, Anchorage, and Tokyo remain advisory/source-reported only inside the package.
  Wired the package into [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx) as snapshot/export metadata under `aerospaceVaacAdvisoryReportPackage` and into [aerospaceExportProfiles.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceExportProfiles.ts) as a compact `vaac-advisory-report-package` footer section plus metadata-key coverage across the aerospace export profiles.

  Extended prepared aerospace smoke assertions in [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) so aircraft and satellite metadata checks now require `aerospaceVaacAdvisoryReportPackage`, advisory rows, VAAC source coverage, metadata-key coverage, does-not-prove lines, and the no-route-impact guardrail.
  Updated [aerospaceWorkflowEvidenceLedger.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceWorkflowEvidenceLedger.ts), [aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md), [aerospace-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-validation.md), and [aircraft-satellite-smoke.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aircraft-satellite-smoke.md) so the package is documented as a bounded VAAC advisory/report consumer rather than a new analyst-facing surface.

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-04 23:26 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Build a bounded aerospace report-brief package on top of the existing fusion-snapshot input without adding a new large analyst surface.
- What changed:
  Added the new pure helper [aerospaceReportBriefPackage.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceReportBriefPackage.ts).
  This helper builds only on the existing `aerospaceFusionSnapshotInput` package and does not create another aerospace review/export/timeline surface.
  It converts the fusion input into four bounded report-ready sections:
  `observe`,
  `orient`,
  `prioritize`,
  and `explain`.
  The package preserves:
  selected-target label,
  active export-profile label,
  validation posture,
  export-readiness posture,
  source ids,
  source modes,
  source health states,
  evidence bases,
  distinct context classes,
  attention counts,
  report-safe lines,
  and explicit does-not-prove/guardrail wording.
  It keeps observed, forecast, advisory, archive, anonymous-comparison, and validation context distinct by reading the grouped fusion-input sections rather than recomputing source semantics.
  Wired the package into [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx) as snapshot/export metadata under `aerospaceReportBriefPackage` and into [aerospaceExportProfiles.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceExportProfiles.ts) as a compact `report-brief-package` footer section plus metadata-key coverage across the aerospace export profiles.
  Added the focused regression [aerospaceReportBriefPackageRegression.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/aerospaceReportBriefPackageRegression.mjs) and exposed it in [package.json](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/package.json).
  Extended prepared aerospace smoke assertions in [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) so aircraft and satellite metadata checks now require `aerospaceReportBriefPackage`, the four report-brief sections, distinct context-class coverage, and the report-accounting guardrail.

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-04 22:59 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Build a bounded aerospace fusion-snapshot input package from the existing aerospace helper stack without adding a new review surface.
- What changed:
  Added the new pure helper [aerospaceFusionSnapshotInput.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceFusionSnapshotInput.ts).
  This helper composes the existing aerospace package stack only:
  selected-target evidence summary,
  context snapshot/report,
  context review queue and export bundle,
  issue export bundle,
  workflow readiness package,
  workflow validation evidence snapshot,
  evidence timeline package,
  package coherence,
  export profile,
  and export readiness.
  It does not add a new user-facing review panel.
  Instead it creates a stable `aerospaceFusionSnapshotInput` metadata shape for a future cross-domain Source Fusion Snapshot.
  The package preserves:
  selected-target summary lines,
  source ids,
  source modes,
  source health states,
  evidence bases,
  active export-profile label,
  validation posture,
  export-readiness posture,
  compact source-summary lines,
  review/issue/missing-evidence/coherence attention counts,
  explicit does-not-prove lines,
  and export-safe lines.
  It keeps observed, forecast, advisory, source-reported, archive, reference, anonymous-comparison, derived, and validation context distinct by grouping the existing evidence-timeline entries instead of collapsing them.
  Wired the package into [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx) as snapshot/export metadata under `aerospaceFusionSnapshotInput` and into [aerospaceExportProfiles.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceExportProfiles.ts) as a compact `fusion-snapshot-input` footer section plus metadata-key coverage across the aerospace export profiles.
  Added the focused regression [aerospaceFusionSnapshotInputRegression.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/aerospaceFusionSnapshotInputRegression.mjs) and exposed it in [package.json](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/package.json).
  Extended prepared aerospace smoke assertions in [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) so aircraft and satellite metadata checks now require `aerospaceFusionSnapshotInput`, distinct archive/comparison or archive/validation section coverage, does-not-prove lines, and the metadata/accounting input guardrail.
  Updated [aerospaceWorkflowEvidenceLedger.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceWorkflowEvidenceLedger.ts), [aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md), [aerospace-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-validation.md), and [aircraft-satellite-smoke.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aircraft-satellite-smoke.md) so the new package is documented as a future cross-domain input rather than a new analyst-facing aerospace surface.

- Validation:
  From `app/client`, `node --experimental-strip-types --experimental-specifier-resolution=node scripts/aerospaceFusionSnapshotInputRegression.mjs` passed and reported the expected fusion package id, evidence-class sections, validation posture, and export-readiness posture.
  `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_ourairports_reference_contracts.py -q` passed (`6 passed`).
  `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_ncei_space_weather_portal_contracts.py -q` passed (`5 passed`).

  `python -m compileall app/server/src` passed.
  From `app/client`, `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint` passed.
  From `app/client`, `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` passed.
  `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` failed before app assertions with Chromium launch `spawn EPERM`; runner diagnosis remained `windows-playwright-launch-permission`.
  `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json` passed and currently reports `2` open low-priority alert lines owned by Atlas AI.
- Blockers or caveats:
  Prepared smoke remains prepared smoke and is still distinct from executed workflow evidence.
  The current active blocker is still the same host-level Windows Chromium launch permission boundary before Playwright reaches app assertions.
  The new fusion-snapshot input package is metadata/accounting only.
  It does not replace the existing aerospace review/export/timeline packages and does not imply flight intent, airport/runway availability, route impact, target behavior, GPS/radio/satellite failure, threat, causation, safety conclusion, or action recommendation.
- Next recommended task:
  Re-run `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` on a Windows host where Chromium launch is permitted so the prepared `aerospaceFusionSnapshotInput` assertions can move from prepared coverage to executed workflow evidence if they pass.

## 2026-05-04 22:29 America/Chicago

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-04 22:11 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Add a bounded aerospace package-coherence and source-health/export parity surface across the existing aerospace helper/export stack without adding another renamed review/export/timeline package.
- What changed:
  Added the new pure helper [aerospacePackageCoherence.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospacePackageCoherence.ts).
  This helper checks parity across the existing aerospace package stack only:
  context-review queue,
  context-review export bundle,
  issue export bundle,
  selected-target snapshot/report package,
  workflow-readiness package,
  workflow-validation evidence snapshot,
  and evidence timeline package.
  It avoids duplication by treating those existing packages as the stable aerospace domain surface instead of creating another user-facing review or export helper.
  The new coherence surface checks:
  stable source-id sets,
  source-mode/source-health/evidence-basis parity where queue/export pairs should match,
  prepared-vs-executed smoke posture consistency across workflow packages,
  export-profile metadata-key coverage,
  missing-evidence-count parity,
  review-count parity,
  and explicit no-inference/does-not-prove guardrail coverage.
  Wired the package into [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx) as `aerospacePackageCoherence` and into [aerospaceExportProfiles.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceExportProfiles.ts) as a compact `package-coherence` footer section plus metadata-key coverage for all aerospace export profiles.
  Added the focused static regression [aerospacePackageCoherenceRegression.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/aerospacePackageCoherenceRegression.mjs) and exposed it in [package.json](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/package.json).
  Extended prepared metadata smoke assertions in [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) so aircraft and satellite export checks now require `aerospacePackageCoherence`, aligned coherence state, zero unexpected review findings, metadata-key coverage, and the accounting-only guardrail.
  Updated [aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md), [aerospace-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-validation.md), and [aircraft-satellite-smoke.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aircraft-satellite-smoke.md) to document the new parity surface as non-duplicative metadata/accounting only.

  `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json` passed and currently reports `3` open low-priority alert lines owned by Atlas AI and Manager AI.
- Blockers or caveats:
  Prepared smoke remains prepared smoke and is still distinct from executed workflow evidence.

  The new package-coherence surface is metadata/accounting only.
  It does not imply source certification, flight intent, airport/runway availability, route impact, target behavior, GPS/radio/satellite failure, threat, causation, safety conclusion, or action recommendation.

  Re-run `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` on a Windows host where Chromium launch is permitted so the prepared `aerospacePackageCoherence` assertions can move from prepared coverage to executed workflow evidence if they pass.

## 2026-05-04 22:06 America/Chicago

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-04 21:52 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Add a bounded aerospace evidence timeline/export package over existing source-backed selected-target context, availability accounting, workflow-validation posture, and source-health evidence without adding new sources or collapsing prepared smoke into executed smoke.
- What changed:
  Added the new pure helper [aerospaceEvidenceTimelinePackage.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceEvidenceTimelinePackage.ts).
  The package builds compact export-safe timeline entries from already-loaded aerospace summaries only:
  selected-target data health,
  AWC METAR/TAF,
  FAA NAS airport status,
  OurAirports reference context,
  OpenSky anonymous comparison,
  USGS geomagnetism,
  CNEOS close-approach/fireball context,
  SWPC current advisory context,
  NCEI archive metadata,
  VAAC advisory context,
  context-availability accounting,
  and workflow-validation posture.
  It preserves source ids, source modes, source health states, evidence bases, observed/source timestamps where available, prepared/executed smoke posture, missing-evidence rows, export-safe lines, and a non-causation guardrail.
  The helper keeps observed, forecast, archive, reference, anonymous-comparison, advisory/source-reported, derived, and validation entries distinct instead of flattening them into one blended status line.
  Wired the package into [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx) as `aerospaceEvidenceTimelinePackage` and into [aerospaceExportProfiles.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceExportProfiles.ts) as a compact `evidence-timeline` footer section plus metadata-key coverage for all aerospace export profiles.
  Extended [aerospaceWeatherContext.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceWeatherContext.ts) and [aerospaceAirportStatusContext.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceAirportStatusContext.ts) with bounded timestamp fields needed for honest timeline entries rather than scraping display strings.
  Added a focused static regression at [aerospaceEvidenceTimelineRegression.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/aerospaceEvidenceTimelineRegression.mjs) and exposed it in [package.json](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/package.json).
  Extended prepared smoke assertions in [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) so aircraft and satellite metadata checks now require `aerospaceEvidenceTimelinePackage`, timeline entry arrays, missing-evidence rows, export-profile metadata-key coverage, and the explicit non-causation guardrail.
  Updated [aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md), [aerospace-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-validation.md), and [aircraft-satellite-smoke.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aircraft-satellite-smoke.md) so the new package is documented as export/review accounting only.

- Blockers or caveats:
  Prepared smoke remains prepared smoke and is still separate from executed workflow evidence.
  The current blocker is the same host-level Windows Chromium launch permission boundary before Playwright reaches app assertions.
  The evidence timeline is export/review accounting only.
  Timeline order is not causation, and the package does not imply flight intent, airport/runway availability, target behavior, GPS/radio/satellite failure, route impact, threat, causation, safety conclusion, or action recommendation.
- Next recommended task:

## 2026-05-04 21:49 America/Chicago

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-04 21:43 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Align aerospace workflow-validation evidence docs and regression posture after the new snapshot, acknowledge the stale assignment-marker issue under the current wave, and prepare a clean validation rerun path without adding new aerospace sources.
- What changed:
  Recorded the current assignment version under the active manager wave and explicitly noted that the prior `aerospaceWorkflowValidationEvidenceSnapshot` work was completed under a stale `2026-05-02 15:47 America/Chicago` assignment marker rather than under the current `2026-05-04 21:43 America/Chicago` wave.
  Reviewed the bounded helper/export/inspector/smoke-prep chain around [aerospaceWorkflowValidationEvidenceSnapshot.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceWorkflowValidationEvidenceSnapshot.ts) and confirmed the current gap was documentation/regression-posture clarity rather than missing source or UI semantics.
  Updated [aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md), [aerospace-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-validation.md), and [aircraft-satellite-smoke.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aircraft-satellite-smoke.md) so the current local validation posture is explicit:
  backend contract tests passed,
  frontend build passed,
  frontend lint passed on the current rerun,
  and Playwright aerospace smoke remains blocked before app assertions by the Windows Chromium `spawn EPERM` launcher boundary.
  Added a focused docs-backed checklist/current-posture note instead of widening into new frontend churn or new source work.

  `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` failed before app assertions with Chromium launch `spawn EPERM`; runner diagnosis remained `windows-playwright-launch-permission`.
- Blockers or caveats:
  The stale assignment-marker issue is now corrected in progress truth.
  Prepared smoke remains prepared smoke; it is not executed workflow evidence.
  The current active blocker is the host-level Windows Playwright launcher boundary, not Marine lint and not an aerospace assertion failure.
  No new source, source replacement, flight-intent, airport/runway availability, target-behavior, failure, route-impact, causation, safety-conclusion, or action-recommendation semantics were added.
- Next recommended task:
  Re-run `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` on a Windows host where Chromium launch is permitted so the prepared `aerospaceWorkflowValidationEvidenceSnapshot` assertions can move from prepared coverage to executed workflow evidence if they pass.

## 2026-05-04 21:26 America/Chicago

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-02 15:47 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Recover the missing `2026-05-02 12:27 America/Chicago` progress truth, then add a bounded aerospace workflow-validation evidence snapshot over the existing selected-target report package, context review queue/export bundle, workflow readiness package, and OurAirports reference context.
- What changed:
  First, backfilled the missing final report for assignment `2026-05-02 12:27 America/Chicago` in this progress doc.
  That prior assignment was already complete in code as the selected-target aerospace report package, and the missing issue was progress-doc truth rather than missing implementation.
  Then added the new pure helper [aerospaceWorkflowValidationEvidenceSnapshot.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceWorkflowValidationEvidenceSnapshot.ts).
  The helper composes the existing selected-target report package, context review queue, context review export bundle, workflow readiness package, and OurAirports reference context into one compact validation-accounting snapshot.
  It preserves:
  validation posture,
  prepared smoke status,
  executed smoke status,
  selected-target report readiness,
  missing-evidence count,
  source ids,
  source modes,
  source health states,
  evidence bases,
  compact display/export lines,
  and explicit validation-accounting guardrail wording.
  Wired the new snapshot into [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx) under `aerospaceWorkflowValidationEvidenceSnapshot`, added compact footer support in [aerospaceExportProfiles.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceExportProfiles.ts), and added a compact `Aerospace Workflow Validation Evidence` inspector section in [InspectorPanel.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx).
  Extended prepared smoke assertions in [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) so aircraft and satellite metadata checks now require `aerospaceWorkflowValidationEvidenceSnapshot`, require `sourceIds`, require export-profile metadata-key coverage, and require the validation-accounting guardrail wording.
  Updated [aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md), [aerospace-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-validation.md), and [aircraft-satellite-smoke.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aircraft-satellite-smoke.md) so the new validation snapshot is documented with the same prepared-vs-executed smoke distinction as the rest of the aerospace workflow model.

  `python -m compileall app/server/src` passed.
  From `app/client`, `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` passed.
  From `app/client`, `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint` failed, but not because of aerospace; current blocker is unrelated marine lint drift in [marineEvidenceSummary.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineEvidenceSummary.ts): unused `MarineHydrologySourceHealthWorkflowSummary`.
  `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` failed before browser assertions with Playwright Chromium launch `spawn EPERM`; runner diagnosis remained `windows-playwright-launch-permission`.
- Blockers or caveats:
  The prior `2026-05-02 12:27 America/Chicago` assignment was already complete in code and is now backfilled in this progress doc.
  The new workflow-validation evidence snapshot is validation-accounting only.
  It does not convert prepared smoke into executed smoke, and it does not imply source certainty, airport/runway availability, target behavior, failure proof, route impact, causation, safety conclusion, or action recommendation.
  Executed aerospace smoke evidence remains blocked on this host by the Windows Playwright launcher boundary before app assertions begin.
  Client lint is currently blocked by an unrelated marine file and was not fixed in this aerospace task.
- Next recommended task:
  Re-run `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` on a Windows host where Playwright Chromium can launch so the prepared `aerospaceWorkflowValidationEvidenceSnapshot` assertions can move from prepared coverage to executed workflow evidence if they pass, and let the marine owner clear the unrelated lint blocker before using lint as aerospace completion evidence again.

## 2026-05-04 11:47 America/Chicago

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-02 12:27 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Backfilled missing final report for the already-completed selected-target aerospace report package assignment.
- What changed:
  Progress truth recovery only.
  Manager AI's `2026-05-02 12:27 America/Chicago` assignment for Aerospace AI was `selected-target aerospace report package`, and the corresponding implementation was already present in the workspace as the bounded snapshot/report package helper [aerospaceContextSnapshotReport.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceContextSnapshotReport.ts) plus its export wiring.
  This entry backfills the missing final report so the aerospace progress doc matches the code and manager check-in history.
  That completed package composes the existing source-readiness bundle, context gap queue, current/archive separation, export coherence, and issue-export-bundle summaries into one compact report-facing metadata package.
  It preserves package profile, source ids, source modes, source health states, evidence bases, review lines, export lines, caveats, guardrail wording, missing metadata keys, missing footer sections, and banned operational-phrase findings without changing source semantics.
  It was wired into [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx) under `aerospaceContextSnapshotReport`, integrated into [aerospaceExportProfiles.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceExportProfiles.ts) for compact footer prioritization, and documented in [aerospace-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-validation.md) and [aircraft-satellite-smoke.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aircraft-satellite-smoke.md).

## 2026-05-02 12:00 America/Chicago

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-02 11:07 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Add a client/backend-light aerospace context review queue and export bundle that prioritizes review gaps across existing aerospace context sources without changing source semantics or crossing no-inference guardrails.
- What changed:
  Added the pure helper [aerospaceContextReviewQueue.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceContextReviewQueue.ts).
  It composes existing context availability, source-readiness bundle posture, context-gap queue items, workflow-readiness missing-evidence rows, export-coherence findings, issue-export-bundle caveat reminders, OurAirports reference-only caveats, and active export-profile context into one prioritized aerospace review queue.
  The queue preserves source ids, source modes, source health states, evidence bases, review-safe lines, export-safe lines, caveats, and an explicit no-severity/no-consequence guardrail.
  Added the pure helper [aerospaceContextReviewExportBundle.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceContextReviewExportBundle.ts).
  It converts the queue into compact export-safe lines while preserving active context-profile linkage, source ids, source modes, source health states, evidence bases, caveats, and explicit export-bundle guardrail wording.
  Wired both helpers into [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx) so snapshot/export metadata now preserves `aerospaceContextReviewQueue` and `aerospaceContextReviewExportBundle`, and existing aerospace export profiles can prioritize their footer lines.
  Added a compact `Aerospace Context Review Queue` inspector section in [InspectorPanel.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx) with the new queue plus a small export-bundle preview.
  Updated [aerospaceExportProfiles.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceExportProfiles.ts), [aerospaceWorkflowEvidenceLedger.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceWorkflowEvidenceLedger.ts), and prepared smoke assertions in [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) so the new metadata keys, footer sections, and guardrail wording are tracked consistently.
  Updated [aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md), [aerospace-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-validation.md), and [aircraft-satellite-smoke.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aircraft-satellite-smoke.md) to document the new queue/export bundle and keep prepared-vs-executed smoke truth explicit.

  `python -m compileall app/server/src` passed.
  From `app/client`, `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint` passed.
  From `app/client`, `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` passed.
  `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` failed before browser assertions with Playwright Chromium launch `spawn EPERM`; runner diagnosis remained `windows-playwright-launch-permission`.
- Blockers or caveats:
  Prepared smoke assertions for `aerospaceContextReviewQueue` and `aerospaceContextReviewExportBundle` are now in place, but executed aerospace smoke evidence is still blocked locally by the existing Windows Playwright Chromium launcher boundary.
  The new queue and export bundle remain review/export accounting only. They do not imply severity, target behavior, airport/runway availability, failure proof, route impact, causation, operational consequence, or action recommendation.
- Next recommended task:
  Re-run `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` on a Windows host where Playwright Chromium can launch so the prepared `aerospaceContextReviewQueue` and `aerospaceContextReviewExportBundle` assertions can move from prepared coverage to executed workflow evidence if they pass.

## 2026-05-02 10:58 America/Chicago

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-02 10:47 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Add a compact aerospace workflow readiness and evidence export package that composes OurAirports context, workflow-evidence ledger state, availability/source-readiness posture, export-profile linkage, and prepared-vs-executed smoke status.
- What changed:
  Added the pure helper [aerospaceWorkflowReadinessPackage.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceWorkflowReadinessPackage.ts).
  The helper composes the existing workflow-evidence ledger, OurAirports reference context, aerospace context availability, aerospace source-readiness posture, and export-profile metadata into one compact evidence-accounting package.
  It preserves source ids, source modes, source health states, evidence bases, prepared/executed smoke status, validation rows, missing-evidence rows, guardrail wording, export lines, and caveats without changing source semantics.
  Wired the new package into [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx) under snapshot/export metadata key `aerospaceWorkflowReadinessPackage` and added footer-priority support in [aerospaceExportProfiles.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceExportProfiles.ts).
  Added a compact `Aerospace Workflow Readiness` inspector section in [InspectorPanel.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx) that shows prepared-vs-executed smoke status, top validation rows, and missing-evidence rows while keeping the Windows Playwright launcher caveat explicit.
  Extended prepared aerospace smoke assertions in [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) so the aircraft workflow now requires the new inspector label and `aerospaceWorkflowReadinessPackage` metadata with validation rows, missing-evidence rows, prepared smoke status, and the evidence-accounting guardrail.
  Updated [aerospace-ourairports-reference.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-ourairports-reference.md), [aerospace-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-validation.md), [aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md), and [aircraft-satellite-smoke.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aircraft-satellite-smoke.md) so the package is documented with the same prepared-vs-executed distinction as the rest of the aerospace workflow evidence model.

  `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` failed before app assertions with Playwright Chromium launch `spawn EPERM`; runner diagnosis remained `windows-playwright-launch-permission`.
- Blockers or caveats:
  Prepared aerospace smoke assertions for the new package are present, but executed workflow-smoke evidence remains blocked locally by the existing Windows Playwright Chromium launcher boundary.
  The new package is workflow/accounting only. It does not certify source truth, does not collapse prepared smoke into executed smoke evidence, and does not imply airport/runway availability, flight intent, target behavior, operational consequence, failure proof, threat, causation, or action recommendation.
- Next recommended task:
  Re-run `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` on a Windows host where Playwright Chromium can launch so the prepared `aerospaceWorkflowReadinessPackage` assertions can move from prepared coverage to executed workflow evidence if they pass.

## 2026-05-02 10:48 America/Chicago

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-02 10:34 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Add deterministic OurAirports reference support to the aerospace smoke fixture lane and prepare aerospace smoke assertions for the OurAirports reference context.
- What changed:
  Added a deterministic aerospace smoke-fixture response path for `GET /api/aerospace/reference/ourairports` in [smoke_fixture_app.py](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/server/tests/smoke_fixture_app.py).
  The new fixture preserves bounded airport/runway reference rows, source mode, source health, export metadata, and explicit reference-only caveats without introducing airport-status or runway-availability semantics.
  Added `ourairports-reference` to the deterministic smoke `/api/status/sources` fixture so aerospace availability and source-health accounting can resolve the same source in smoke mode.
  Extended prepared aerospace smoke assertions in [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) so the aircraft workflow now requires:
  the `OurAirports Reference Context` inspector section,
  `ourairportsReferenceContext` snapshot metadata,
  fixture source mode,
  recognized airport-match status,
  and explicit `doesNotProve` reference-only guardrails.
  Updated [aerospace-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-validation.md) and [aircraft-satellite-smoke.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aircraft-satellite-smoke.md) to remove the older “not yet prepared” wording and to record the actual state:
  deterministic smoke fixture support and prepared assertions now exist, while executed smoke evidence remains blocked locally by Playwright Chromium launch permission failure on this Windows host.

  `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` failed before app assertions with Playwright Chromium launch `spawn EPERM`; the runner diagnosis was `windows-playwright-launch-permission`.
- Blockers or caveats:
  Executed aerospace smoke evidence for the OurAirports slice is still blocked locally by the known Windows Playwright Chromium launch permission boundary, so this pass only promotes the slice to deterministic fixture support plus prepared assertion coverage.
  The OurAirports slice remains baseline/reference-only and comparison-only. It does not replace selected-target evidence and does not imply aircraft identity validation, airport status, runway availability, route impact, flight intent, operational consequence, threat, causation, or action guidance.
- Next recommended task:
  Re-run `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` on a Windows host where Playwright Chromium can actually launch, then promote the prepared OurAirports aerospace smoke coverage to executed workflow evidence if the new assertions pass.

## 2026-05-02 10:23 America/Chicago

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-02 10:01 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Add a bounded aerospace consumer for `ourairports-reference` that supports selected-target airport/reference comparison and export context while keeping reference data separate from live selected-target evidence.
- What changed:
  Added typed client contracts for the OurAirports aerospace route in [api.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/types/api.ts) and a narrow client query hook `useOurAirportsReferenceQuery(...)` in [queries.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/lib/queries.ts).
  Added a new pure helper [aerospaceReferenceContext.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceReferenceContext.ts) that builds a bounded selected-aircraft reference comparison summary from already-loaded airport/runway context and the new OurAirports response.
  That helper preserves source mode, source health/state, bounded airport/runway counts, selected airport/runway basis, airport match status, runway match status, compact display/export lines, explicit caveats, and explicit `does not prove` lines.
  Wired the helper into existing aerospace context surfaces:
  [aerospaceOperationalContext.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceOperationalContext.ts),
  [aerospaceContextAvailability.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceContextAvailability.ts),
  and [aerospaceExportProfiles.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceExportProfiles.ts).
  Added one compact inspector section, `OurAirports Reference Context`, in [InspectorPanel.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx) and preserved machine-readable snapshot/export metadata under `ourairportsReferenceContext` in [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx).
  Updated aerospace docs in [aerospace-ourairports-reference.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-ourairports-reference.md), [aerospace-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-validation.md), [aerospace-source-contract-matrix.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-source-contract-matrix.md), and [aircraft-satellite-smoke.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aircraft-satellite-smoke.md).
  I intentionally deferred prepared Playwright assertions for this slice because the current aerospace smoke fixture lane does not yet expose a dedicated OurAirports reference endpoint; the docs now record that deferral explicitly instead of overstating coverage.

  `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` failed before app assertions with Playwright Chromium launch `spawn EPERM`; runner diagnosis remained `windows-playwright-launch-permission`.

  This pass required narrow edits to shared aerospace-hosting frontend files [InspectorPanel.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx) and [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx) because that is where aerospace inspector sections and snapshot/export metadata already live.
  The new consumer is reference-only and comparison-only. It does not replace selected-target evidence, does not validate aircraft identity, and does not imply airport status, runway availability, flight intent, route impact, operational consequence, threat, causation, or action guidance.
  Executed aerospace smoke evidence for this new slice remains blocked locally by the known Windows Playwright launcher boundary. Prepared OurAirports smoke assertions were intentionally deferred rather than overstated.
- Next recommended task:
  Add a deterministic OurAirports reference endpoint to the aerospace smoke fixture lane, then add prepared metadata/text assertions for `ourairportsReferenceContext` and the `OurAirports Reference Context` inspector section before trying to promote that slice to executed workflow-smoke evidence.

## 2026-05-02 09:58 America/Chicago

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-02 09:46 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Implement a backend-first `ourairports-reference` slice for bounded public airport/runway reference context, fixture-first and caveat/export aware.
- What changed:
  Added a new backend-only aerospace route [ourairports_reference.py](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/server/src/routes/ourairports_reference.py) at `GET /api/aerospace/reference/ourairports`.
  Added typed contracts in [api.py](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/server/src/types/api.py) for source health, airport records, runway records, backend export metadata, and the full response shape.
  Added fixture-first source loading in [ourairports_reference.py](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/server/src/adapters/ourairports_reference.py), reusing the existing OurAirports parser but keeping this slice separate from the shared reference database and shared reference route surface.
  Added bounded response shaping and filtering in [ourairports_reference_service.py](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/server/src/services/ourairports_reference_service.py) for `q`, `airport_code`, `country_code`, `region_code`, `airport_type`, `include_runways`, and `limit`.
  Added deterministic CSV fixtures under [ourairports_reference_fixture](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/server/data/ourairports_reference_fixture) and focused contract coverage in [test_ourairports_reference_contracts.py](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/server/tests/test_ourairports_reference_contracts.py) for fixture serialization, filtering, source mode/health, explicit empty behavior, missing-coordinate handling, caveat preservation, and backend export metadata.
  Registered the new route in [app.py](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/server/src/app.py) and added runtime source-status exposure in [status_service.py](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/server/src/services/status_service.py) as `ourairports-reference`.
  Added aerospace docs in [aerospace-ourairports-reference.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-ourairports-reference.md) and updated [aerospace-source-contract-matrix.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-source-contract-matrix.md), [aerospace-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-validation.md), and [source-validation-status.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/source-validation-status.md).

- Blockers or caveats:
  This slice is backend-first only. No frontend consumer, smoke path, or client export consumer was added in this assignment.
  Reference data remains baseline/contextual only. It does not imply live airport status, runway availability, facility access, flight intent, route impact, operational consequence, or action guidance.
  I observed unrelated pre-existing edits in shared server files during diff review and did not revert or take ownership of them.
- Next recommended task:
  Add one bounded aerospace consumer of `ourairports-reference` for selected-target reference comparison or export context, while keeping reference data read-only and separate from live selected-target evidence.

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-02 09:12 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Add an aerospace workflow evidence ledger/helper that distinguishes backend contract evidence, client lint/build evidence, prepared smoke assertions, and executed smoke evidence.
- What changed:
  Added a new pure helper [aerospaceWorkflowEvidenceLedger.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceWorkflowEvidenceLedger.ts) that defines a compact aerospace workflow-evidence ledger with explicit row categories for implemented helper surfaces, snapshot/export metadata keys, backend contract suites, client validation, prepared smoke assertions, and executed smoke status.
  The helper preserves a compact ledger line, row statuses, coverage item lists, caveats, and a strict guardrail line that this is workflow-accounting only and not a severity, operational-consequence, failure-proof, threat, causation, or action-recommendation surface.
  Added a dedicated docs-backed ledger in [aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-evidence-ledger.md) so future agents can see the current aerospace validation truth in one place without confusing prepared smoke assertions with executed smoke evidence.
  Updated [aerospace-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-validation.md) to point directly to the new ledger and to state explicitly that prepared smoke coverage must not be promoted while the local Playwright launcher remains blocked.
  Updated [aircraft-satellite-smoke.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aircraft-satellite-smoke.md) so the smoke checklist now defers the prepared-vs-executed distinction to the new ledger and repeats that the local `spawn EPERM` boundary is a machine-environment blocker rather than an aerospace assertion result.
  I did not add frontend unit tests because there is no existing lightweight frontend helper-test harness in this assignment path, and the helper is docs/report-accounting only. The practical validation here is typechecked helper code plus explicit docs and the existing smoke-runner status.

  `python -m compileall app/server/src` passed.
  `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint` initially failed inside the sandbox with TSConfig path-mirroring parser errors against `C:\Users\CodexSandboxOnline\.codex\.sandbox\cwd\...`; rerunning the same command outside the sandbox passed, so there is no current aerospace lint regression in the real workspace.
  `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` passed from `app/client`.
  `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` failed before browser assertions with Playwright Chromium launch `spawn EPERM`; runner diagnosis remained `windows-playwright-launch-permission`.
- Blockers or caveats:
  Executed aerospace smoke evidence remains locally blocked by the Windows Playwright launcher boundary, so the ledger must keep smoke in the `prepared` or `blocked` buckets on this host.
  The helper and docs are workflow-accounting only. They do not imply flight intent, route impact, operational consequence, GPS/radio/satellite failure proof, severity, threat, causation, target exposure, or action recommendation.
- Next recommended task:
  Re-run `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` on a Windows host where Playwright Chromium can launch, then update the ledger rows from `prepared`/`blocked` to `executed` only for the assertions that actually run and pass.

- Task:
  Add an aerospace context snapshot/report metadata package that composes readiness, gap queue, current/archive context, export coherence, and issue-export-bundle outputs into a compact report-facing export helper.
- What changed:
  Added a new pure helper [aerospaceContextSnapshotReport.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceContextSnapshotReport.ts) that composes the existing source-readiness bundle, context gap queue, current/archive separation, export coherence, and issue-export-bundle summaries into one bounded snapshot/report metadata package.
  The new helper preserves package profile, source ids, source modes, source health states, evidence bases, review lines, export lines, caveats, guardrail wording, missing metadata keys, and missing footer sections without re-implementing the underlying readiness/gap/current-archive/coherence logic.
  Added an internal bounded package-profile option:
  `default`,
  `source-health-review`,
  and `space-weather-context`.
  This stays pure and is mapped from the existing aerospace export-profile selection inside [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx), so there is no new UI or store state.
  Extended [aerospaceExportProfiles.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceExportProfiles.ts) so all aerospace export profiles now preserve the new `aerospaceContextSnapshotReport` machine metadata key and can prioritize compact `snapshot-report-package` footer lines.
  Wired the new package narrowly into [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx) under `aerospaceContextSnapshotReport` plus export-footer shaping only.
  Extended prepared aerospace smoke assertions in [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) so aircraft and satellite metadata checks now require `aerospaceContextSnapshotReport`, require review lines and guardrail wording, require profile metadata coverage, and require zero unguarded operational-phrase findings.
  Updated [aerospace-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-validation.md) and [aircraft-satellite-smoke.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aircraft-satellite-smoke.md) to document the new snapshot/report package behavior and keep the local Playwright launcher limitation explicit.

  The new snapshot/report package remains compact report/export metadata only. It does not imply severity, operational consequence, failure proof, route impact, target exposure, threat, causation, or action recommendation.
  Executed aerospace smoke evidence for the new `aerospaceContextSnapshotReport` assertions is still blocked on this Windows host because Playwright cannot launch before browser assertions.
- Next recommended task:
  Re-run `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` on a Windows host where Playwright Chromium can launch, then convert the prepared `aerospaceContextSnapshotReport` assertions into executed workflow evidence if they pass.

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-01 15:03 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Add an aerospace source-health/readiness issue export bundle that composes readiness bundle, context gap queue, current/archive separation, and export coherence into compact review-only export items.
- What changed:
  Added a new pure helper [aerospaceIssueExportBundle.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceIssueExportBundle.ts) that builds a compact review-only issue export bundle from the existing source-readiness bundle, context gap queue, current/archive space-weather separation summary, and export-coherence summary.
  The new bundle preserves item category, source ids, source modes, source health states, evidence bases, caveats, guardrail lines, and any missing metadata-key or footer-section findings already surfaced by export coherence.
  Added explicit unguarded operational-phrase scanning for `operational consequence`, `severity`, `failure proof`, `route impact`, `target exposure`, `causation`, `threat`, and action-recommendation wording, while still allowing guarded caveat phrasing such as `does not imply severity`.
  Extended [aerospaceExportProfiles.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceExportProfiles.ts) so aerospace export profiles can preserve the new machine metadata key and optionally prioritize compact issue-bundle footer lines without changing source semantics or adding new UI sections.
  Wired the new bundle narrowly into [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx) under `aerospaceIssueExportBundle` and as an export-footer input only; no new inspector surface was added in this assignment.
  Hardened the prepared aerospace smoke assertions in [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) so aircraft and satellite export metadata now require `aerospaceIssueExportBundle`, require current/archive separation coverage inside the bundle, require per-item review-only guardrails, and require zero unguarded operational-phrase findings.
  Updated [aerospace-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-workflow-validation.md) and [aircraft-satellite-smoke.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aircraft-satellite-smoke.md) to document the new issue-export-bundle behavior and keep the local Playwright launcher limitation explicit.

- Task:
  Add an aerospace export/coherence helper that checks source-readiness bundle, context gap queue, current/archive separation, and export profile metadata stay aligned without adding operational inference.
- What changed:
  Added a new pure helper [aerospaceExportCoherence.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceExportCoherence.ts) that summarizes export coherence across the existing source-readiness bundle, context gap queue, current/archive separation helper, and export-profile metadata.
  The helper preserves source ids, source modes, source health states, evidence bases, guardrail lines, caveats, aligned metadata keys, missing metadata keys, missing footer sections, and any unguarded operational-phrase findings.
  Tightened [aerospaceSourceReadiness.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceSourceReadiness.ts) bundle metadata so coherence checks can see per-family source ids and evidence bases.
  Extended [aerospaceExportProfiles.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceExportProfiles.ts) metadata to preserve `includedMetadataKeys` and added an `export-coherence` footer section so the helper can measure alignment against the profile's declared export shape instead of inferring it indirectly.
  Wired coherence narrowly into [AppShell.tsx](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx) as snapshot/export metadata under `aerospaceExportCoherence` and as optional footer-line input. No new inspector UI section was added.
  Extended prepared aerospace smoke assertions in [playwright_smoke.mjs](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs) so aircraft and satellite export metadata now require `aerospaceExportCoherence`, require an `aligned` coherence state under the default export profile, and require zero unguarded operational-phrase findings.
  Updated aerospace workflow and smoke docs to document coherence behavior and the continuing local Playwright launcher limitation.

- Task:
  Build an aerospace current-versus-archive context helper that keeps current NOAA SWPC advisory context separate from archival NOAA NCEI space-weather metadata in inspector/export summaries and smoke-prep coverage.
- What changed:
  Added a new pure helper [aerospaceCurrentArchiveContext.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/inspector/aerospaceCurrentArchiveContext.ts) that composes already-loaded SWPC and NCEI archive summaries without changing source semantics.
  The helper preserves separate current and archive source ids, source modes, source health states, evidence-basis labels, current advisory timing labels, archive temporal-coverage labels, bounded display/export lines, and an explicit guardrail line that archive metadata is not current warning truth and current advisories do not prove GPS, radio, satellite, or aircraft failure.
  Wired the helper narrowly into the aerospace inspector as a compact `Current vs Archive Space-Weather Context` section, into export footer shaping, and into snapshot/export metadata under `aerospaceCurrentArchiveContext`.
  Extended prepared aerospace smoke assertions so aircraft and satellite metadata checks now expect the new inspector label, metadata key, separation state, and guardrail wording when Playwright can launch.
  Updated aerospace workflow and smoke docs to document the new separation helper, metadata key, and no-inference boundaries.

## 2026-05-01 13:09 America/Chicago

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-01 13:04 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Run a validation recovery and hardening pass for the aerospace source-readiness bundle plus context gap queue, and convert prepared smoke assertions into executed evidence if local Playwright launch permits it.
- What changed:
  Re-ran the aerospace backend contract suite, server compile, client lint, client build, and the aerospace Playwright smoke lane against the current tree.
  No aerospace code or doc semantics needed to change in this recovery pass because the source-readiness bundle and context gap queue assertions were already prepared correctly.
  Confirmed that the aerospace smoke lane still does not reach app assertions on this Windows host. It fails before browser launch with the known Playwright `spawn EPERM` / `windows-browser-launch-permission` boundary, so there is still no executed smoke evidence to promote in the docs.
  A new non-aerospace client build blocker also surfaced during recovery: [marineContextHelperRegression.ts](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/client/src/features/marine/marineContextHelperRegression.ts) is using `.ts` extension imports that TypeScript rejects under current settings. Per assignment, I did not touch marine files and am routing that blocker to Connect AI.

  `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` failed before browser assertions with Playwright Chromium launch `spawn EPERM`; runner diagnosis remained `windows-playwright-launch-permission`.
- Blockers or caveats:
  Prepared aerospace smoke assertions for `aerospaceSourceReadinessBundle` and `aerospaceContextGapQueue` still exist, but there is still no executed smoke evidence on this Windows host because the browser cannot launch.
  The current client build blocker is outside aerospace ownership and should go to Connect AI.
- Next recommended task:
  After Connect AI clears the unrelated marine import-extension build blocker and on a Windows host where Playwright Chromium can launch, rerun `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` and `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` to convert the prepared bundle/gap-queue assertions into executed workflow evidence if they pass.

  2026-05-01 12:45 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Build an aerospace context gap review queue that summarizes unavailable, stale, fixture-backed, empty, degraded, or archive/current-separation context families with export-ready caveats and no operational inference.
- What changed:
  Added a new pure helper `aerospaceContextGapQueue.ts` that builds a bounded aerospace context gap queue from existing context availability and source-readiness summaries plus selected-target/export-profile inputs.
  The queue emits review items for unavailable expected context, degraded source health, stale or limited freshness, empty optional windows, fixture-backed context, and current/archive space-weather separation gaps.
  Each queue item preserves family label, source ids, source modes, source health, evidence basis, summary text, export-ready line, caveat, and an explicit no-severity/no-consequence `guardrailLine`.
  Wired the queue into the aerospace inspector as a compact `Aerospace Context Gap Queue` section, into export profile footer prioritization, and into snapshot/export metadata under `aerospaceContextGapQueue`.
  Extended prepared aerospace smoke assertions so aircraft and satellite paths now expect the new inspector label, queue metadata, queue items, and guardrail line when Playwright can launch.
  Updated aerospace workflow and smoke docs to document the gap queue, its metadata key, and its no-inference boundaries.

- Blockers or caveats:
  Stopped after the unrelated marine build failure as required by the assignment. I did not modify marine files.
  Because build is currently blocked outside aerospace, I did not continue to the Playwright smoke step in this pass.
  The new gap queue remains review-oriented and non-operational. It does not imply severity, flight intent, route impact, aircraft exposure, GPS/radio/satellite failure, causation, operational consequence, or action recommendation.
- Next recommended task:
  Wait for Connect AI to clear the unrelated marine build blocker, then rerun `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` and `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` to convert the prepared `aerospaceContextGapQueue` assertions into executed workflow evidence.

- Task:
  Add an aerospace-local export bundle selector for source-readiness context so compact family-specific readiness/caveat/export lines can be emitted without drifting into severity semantics.
- What changed:
  Added aerospace-local bundle state in `store.ts` for `selectedAerospaceSourceReadinessBundle`, with default `all-families` and a dedicated setter so export behavior stays deterministic across inspector and snapshot metadata.
  Extended `aerospaceSourceReadiness.ts` with predefined export bundles and a new pure helper `buildAerospaceSourceReadinessBundleSummary(...)`. The bundle summary preserves bundle id/label, selected family ids, per-family readiness labels, family posture, source modes, health states, summary lines, caveats, a top review note, and an explicit no-severity/no-action `guardrailLine`.
  Wired the bundle selector into the aerospace inspector as a compact `Readiness bundle` control and bundle summary card inside the existing `Aerospace Source Readiness` section.
  Wired compact bundle export lines into the existing export-profile helper and preserved machine-readable snapshot metadata under `aerospaceSourceReadinessBundle`.
  Extended prepared aerospace smoke assertions so aircraft and satellite metadata checks now expect `aerospaceSourceReadinessBundle`, bundled family rows, and the bundle-specific guardrail wording.
  Updated aerospace workflow/smoke docs to document bundle behavior, preserved fields, and the no-severity/no-action boundary.

- Assignment version:
  2026-05-01 11:26 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Add review/report phrasing safeguards and export-readiness caveat checks for the aerospace source-readiness federation so it stays review-oriented rather than reading like operational severity.
- What changed:
  Hardened `aerospaceSourceReadiness.ts` so the federation now emits an explicit `guardrailLine` stating that source readiness is review-oriented context accounting only, not operational severity or a recommended action.
  Tightened family readiness labels to preserve review phrasing under degraded, unavailable, stale, or fixture-backed conditions, for example `review degraded context`, `review unavailable context`, `review fixture-backed context`, and `review freshness-limited context`.
  Updated source-readiness display/export lines so they now say `families need review`, `family coverage`, and `top review note` rather than leaning on raw degraded-family phrasing alone.
  Hardened prepared smoke assertions so aerospace smoke now expects `aerospaceSourceReadiness.guardrailLine` to contain `review-oriented` and expects the source-readiness caveats to preserve the no-severity boundary.
  Updated aerospace workflow and smoke docs to record the new phrasing guardrails and smoke-prep evidence for the source-readiness federation.

- Assignment version:
  2026-04-30 22:19 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Add an aerospace-local source-health/context issue federation package that summarizes availability, caveats, and export readiness across the major aerospace context families without inventing a severity score.
- What changed:
  Added a new pure helper `aerospaceSourceReadiness.ts` that federates already-loaded aerospace context availability, context-review issues, export readiness, and selected-target data health into bounded family summaries for airport operations, OpenSky comparison, space events, current space-weather context, archive context, and selected-target evidence.
  Each family preserves per-source availability, source mode, source health, evidence basis, reasons, caveats, and selected-target freshness where applicable, then emits a bounded review-oriented readiness label such as `available with caveats`, `review with caveats`, `fixture-backed context`, `degraded context`, `context unavailable`, or `freshness limited`.
  Wired the new federation into the aerospace inspector as a compact `Aerospace Source Readiness` section, into export footer prioritization through `aerospaceExportProfiles.ts`, and into snapshot metadata as `aerospaceSourceReadiness`.
  Extended prepared aerospace smoke assertions to expect the new inspector label and metadata key when Playwright can launch, and updated aerospace workflow/smoke docs to describe the new family summary and its no-severity/no-inference boundaries.

  2026-04-30 22:01 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Add the bounded aerospace-local NOAA NCEI space-weather archive consumer/export package, keeping archive metadata separate from current SWPC advisory truth.
- What changed:
  Added typed client contracts and a dedicated `useNceiSpaceWeatherArchiveQuery(...)` hook for the existing `/api/aerospace/space/ncei-space-weather-archive` backend route.
  Added a new pure helper `aerospaceSpaceWeatherArchiveContext.ts` that composes compact archival/contextual `Space Weather Archive Context` summaries from the route output while preserving collection id, dataset identifier, title, temporal coverage, metadata update date, progress status, update frequency, source mode, source health, provenance URLs, and explicit archive-vs-current caveats.
  Wired the new archive summary into the aerospace inspector as a narrow `Space Weather Archive Context` section, aerospace operational-context composition, context-availability rows, export-profile footer prioritization, and snapshot/export metadata under `nceiSpaceWeatherArchiveContext`.
  Added deterministic smoke-fixture coverage for the NCEI archive route and `noaa-ncei-space-weather-portal` source status in `smoke_fixture_app.py`, then extended prepared aerospace smoke assertions to expect the new inspector label and metadata key when Playwright can launch.
  Updated aerospace docs and validation tracking to record the new consumer/export path, the prepared smoke coverage, and the explicit boundary that NOAA NCEI archive metadata is archival/contextual only and must not be treated as current SWPC warning truth or proof of GPS, radio, aircraft, or satellite failure.

- Assignment version:
  2026-04-30 21:43 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Add the backend-only `noaa-ncei-space-weather-portal` first slice as bounded archival/product metadata context for aerospace, with fixture-first contracts, source health, prompt-injection-safe free-text handling, and aerospace docs updates.
- What changed:
  Pinned the public no-auth NOAA NCEI XML metadata endpoint `https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ngdc.stp.swx:space_weather_products;view=xml;responseType=text/xml` for the `Space Weather Products` collection and added backend settings for source mode, URL, timeout, and fixture path.
  Added typed API contracts, a fixture-first adapter, a cached service, and a new route at `/api/aerospace/space/ncei-space-weather-archive` that returns bounded archival collection metadata only: collection id, dataset identifier, title, summary, temporal coverage, metadata update date, progress status, update frequency, source mode, source health, provenance URLs, and explicit archival/context caveats.
  Added deterministic XML fixture coverage, explicit empty-result handling, degraded source-status handling, missing optional-field handling, and untrusted free-text sanitization coverage for title and summary fields so archive metadata remains inert source text rather than executable instructions or UI markup.
  Updated aerospace contract/workflow docs and source-validation tracking to record that this slice is backend-only, contract-tested, separate from NOAA SWPC current advisories, and not yet a frontend/export consumer.

  `python -m compileall app/server/src` passed.
- Blockers or caveats:
  This slice is intentionally backend-only. There is no frontend card, export-profile consumer, or smoke assertion yet, and none were added in this pass.
  NOAA NCEI archive metadata remains archival/contextual only. It is explicitly separate from NOAA SWPC current advisories and must not be used to infer current GPS, radio, aircraft, or satellite failure.
  Free-text title and summary fields are sanitized and truncated before entering the route contract, but they still remain untrusted source text rather than instructions.
- Next recommended task:
  Wait for the next-task doc to assign whether the NCEI archive slice should stay backend-only or gain a bounded aerospace-local consumer later. Do not merge it into SWPC current-advisory semantics.

- Assignment version:
  2026-04-30 17:00 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Add the bounded aerospace-local VAAC context consumer/export package for the Washington, Anchorage, and Tokyo backend advisory routes, including typed client queries, compact inspector/export consumption, deterministic smoke-fixture support, and docs.
- What changed:
  Added typed client API contracts and query hooks for the three VAAC routes, plus a new pure helper `aerospaceVaacContext.ts` that composes per-source advisory counts, source mode/health, top advisory provenance, bounded inert summary text, caveats, and explicit `does not prove` lines without inventing severity or route-impact semantics.
  Wired the new summary into the aerospace inspector as a compact `Volcanic Ash Advisory Context` section, and into the aerospace export path as `vaacContext` snapshot metadata plus profile-aware footer lines.
  Integrated VAAC context into aerospace operational-context composition, aerospace context availability rows, and the `space-context` export profile emphasis so the already-loaded VAAC slice is visible in the existing aerospace workflow without changing source semantics.
  Added deterministic smoke-fixture support for the three VAAC routes and their source-status entries in `smoke_fixture_app.py`, then extended the aerospace smoke assertions to expect the new inspector label and `vaacContext` metadata when the browser can launch.
  Updated aerospace docs to reflect that the VAAC backend slices are now consumed in the client, export-aware, and still bounded to advisory/contextual volcanic-ash summaries only.

  Smoke-fixture assertions and metadata checks for the new VAAC consumer are prepared, but executed smoke evidence is still blocked on this Windows host by the existing Playwright launcher permission boundary rather than an aerospace assertion failure.
  The VAAC consumer remains advisory/contextual only. It does not imply route impact, aircraft exposure, engine risk, threat, failure, causation, operational consequence, or action recommendation.
- Next recommended task:
  Add the next bounded aerospace-local context consumer only if the next-task doc assigns one; otherwise wait for Manager AI or execute the prepared VAAC smoke assertions on a Windows host where Playwright Chromium can actually launch.

- Task:
  Implement the backend-only multi-VAAC follow-on bundle for `anchorage-vaac-advisories` and `tokyo-vaac-advisories`, reusing the Washington pattern without collapsing source-specific provenance or semantics.
- What changed:
  Added backend settings, typed API contracts, fixture-first adapters/services/routes, deterministic fixtures, and focused backend contract tests for both Anchorage VAAC and Tokyo VAAC advisory slices.
  Added a shared aerospace-local text-advisory parser helper for text-product VAAC pages so Anchorage and Tokyo can reuse bounded line-oriented parsing without erasing source-specific route shapes.
  Anchorage is pinned to the official NOAA/NWS Anchorage VAAC listing page `https://www.weather.gov/vaac/` and the linked forecast.weather.gov advisory text-product family `https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=CRH&issuedby=AK[1-5]&product=VAA&format=txt&version=1&glossary=1`.
  Tokyo is pinned to the official JMA Tokyo VAAC listing page `https://www.data.jma.go.jp/vaac/data/vaac_list.html` and the linked text-page family `https://www.data.jma.go.jp/vaac/data/TextData/YYYY/*_Text.html`.
  Both new slices preserve per-source mode, source health, advisory identifiers and timestamps where available, volcano identity, area/source text, per-record source URL, and explicit no-route-impact/no-aircraft-exposure caveats.
  Updated the aerospace contract/workflow docs and smoke checklist to record the new backend-only first-slice status and their bounded no-overclaim semantics.

- Next recommended task:
  Add a future aerospace-owned frontend/export consumer for the three VAAC backend routes together, preserving per-source provenance and caveats without inventing a global severity scale or route-impact layer.

- Task:
  Implement the first bounded backend-only `washington-vaac-advisories` aerospace source slice with fixture-first contracts, explicit source health, official NOAA OSPO endpoint pinning, and documentation updates.
- What changed:
  Added backend settings, typed API contracts, a fixture-first adapter/service/route stack, deterministic fixtures, and focused backend contract tests for Washington VAAC advisories.
  The new route is `/api/aerospace/space/washington-vaac-advisories`.
  Live mode is pinned to the official NOAA OSPO Washington VAAC listing page at `https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/products/atmosphere/vaac/messages.html` and the XML advisory documents linked from that page under `https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/products/atmosphere/vaac/volcanoes/xml_files/FVXX*.xml`.
  The slice preserves advisory number, issue/phenomenon timestamps where available, volcano identity, state/region, summit elevation when exposed, information source, eruption details, motion fields when exposed, per-record source URL, source mode, source health, and explicit no-route-impact/no-aircraft-exposure caveats.
  Added deterministic coverage for:
  active/current advisory data,
  empty/no-current listing behavior,
  missing optional fields,
  volcano filtering,
  source-status degradation reporting,
  and no-overclaim caveat/field guardrails.
  Updated aerospace contract/workflow docs and the smoke checklist to record the backend-only first-slice status and the preserved no-inference boundaries.

- Task:
  Build an aerospace-local context report package that composes selected-target evidence, context availability, review queue, export readiness, and selected-target data health into bounded report lines and exportable metadata.
- What changed:
  Added a new pure helper that builds a compact `Aerospace Context Report` summary from already-loaded aerospace state only.
  The report preserves selected-target label, context-availability counts, review-queue counts, readiness category, selected-target health summary, top caveats, and explicit `what this does not prove` lines.
  Wired the report into the inspector as a compact `Aerospace Context Report` section, preserved machine-readable snapshot/export metadata under `aerospaceContextReport`, and added report-line support to the existing aerospace export-profile footer prioritization without removing full metadata retention.
  Extended deterministic aerospace smoke-prep assertions so aircraft and satellite paths now expect the new inspector label and `aerospaceContextReport` metadata when the browser can launch.
  Updated aerospace workflow/smoke docs to document the new metadata key, report semantics, and the explicit no-inference/no-action-recommendation boundary.

- Next recommended task:
  Re-run `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` on a Windows host where Playwright Chromium can launch, then confirm the prepared `aerospaceContextReport` inspector and metadata assertions execute successfully and update the workflow docs from prepared coverage to executed smoke evidence.

- Task:
  Add a bounded aerospace-local review queue helper on top of the existing context-review and export-readiness stack, preserve it in inspector/export metadata, and harden deterministic smoke-prep assertions.
- What changed:
  Added a new pure helper that converts already-loaded aerospace context review, export readiness, availability, selected-target data health, and guarded OpenSky comparison state into compact review-queue items.
  The queue bands items as `review-first`, `review`, or `note` for analyst organization only and keeps category labels bounded to source context, freshness, comparison, and export-readiness.
  Surfaced the queue in the inspector as a compact `Aerospace Review Queue` section with minimal badge-based presentation, preserved machine-readable metadata under `aerospaceReviewQueue`, and added profile-aware footer support for compact queue lines.
  Extended the deterministic aerospace smoke-prep assertions so they now expect the `Aerospace Review Queue` inspector label plus `aerospaceReviewQueue` metadata keys when the browser can actually launch.
  During validation, fixed one local type mismatch by normalizing OpenSky comparison `source-reported` evidence basis into the queue's existing contextual badge vocabulary instead of widening shared frontend semantics.

- Task:
  Build a bounded aerospace-local export-readiness summary on top of the existing operational-context, availability, and context-review stack, then preserve it in inspector/export metadata without changing source semantics.
- What changed:
  Added a new pure helper that computes compact aerospace export-readiness categories from already-loaded operational context, context availability, context review, and selected-target data health.
  The new readiness helper classifies the current selected-target export context as one of:
  `ready with caveats`,
  `missing optional context`,
  `fixture/local context present`,
  `degraded or unavailable context`,
  or `selected-target freshness limited`.
  The helper keeps the output bounded to export-context completeness and caveat visibility. It does not certify source reliability and does not imply target behavior, threat, failure, causation, or impact.
  Surfaced the summary in the inspector as a compact `Aerospace Export Readiness` section with minimal UI changes, and preserved machine-readable metadata under `aerospaceExportReadiness` in the snapshot/export path.
  Extended the existing aerospace export-profile helper so readiness lines can be prioritized in footer output without changing underlying metadata preservation.
  Updated aerospace smoke-prep assertions to expect the new `aerospaceExportReadiness` metadata and inspector section labels when executed on a host where Playwright can launch.
  Updated aerospace workflow/smoke docs to describe the new readiness feature, its metadata key, and its no-inference boundaries.

- Blockers or caveats:
  Executed aerospace smoke evidence for the new readiness assertions is still blocked on this Windows host by the Playwright launcher permission boundary before any browser assertions run.
  The readiness feature remains an export-context completeness summary only. It does not upgrade fixture data into live truth, does not downgrade optional empty sources into failure claims, and does not imply aircraft intent, satellite failure, GPS/radio failure, threat, causation, or downstream impact.
- Next recommended task:
  Re-run `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` on a Windows host where Playwright Chromium can launch, then confirm the prepared `aerospaceExportReadiness` metadata assertions execute successfully and update the docs from prepared coverage to executed workflow evidence.

- Assignment version:
  2026-04-30 15:11 America/Chicago
- Task:
  Extend aerospace smoke-prep coverage for the new `aerospaceContextIssues` and `geomagnetismContext` metadata outputs, add any deterministic smoke-fixture support they need, and update docs to distinguish prepared assertions from executed smoke on this host.
- What changed:
  Added deterministic USGS geomagnetism support to the aerospace smoke fixture server through `/api/context/geomagnetism/usgs`, including bounded observatory/element handling and an explicit `usgs-geomagnetism` source-status row so the existing aerospace client consumer can load the same contextual-only metadata during smoke.
  Extended the aerospace Playwright smoke script to assert `aerospaceContextIssues` and `geomagnetismContext` in both the aircraft and satellite snapshot metadata paths, and to require the corresponding inspector section labels so the metadata assertions match visible aerospace surfaces.
  Updated aerospace validation docs and the source-contract matrix so they now explicitly say the geomagnetism and aerospace-context-review smoke assertions are prepared, while executed smoke evidence on this Windows host remains blocked by the Playwright Chromium `spawn EPERM` launcher boundary before browser assertions begin.

- Blockers or caveats:
  Executed aerospace smoke evidence on this host is still blocked by the machine-environment Playwright launcher boundary, so this pass hardens prepared assertions and deterministic fixture support rather than converting the docs to a successful executed-smoke state.
  The new geomagnetism smoke fixture remains contextual-only and observatory-scoped. It does not imply avionics, GPS, radio, aircraft, or satellite failure, and the new smoke assertions only check metadata presence and section labels.
- Next recommended task:
  Re-run `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` on a Windows host where Playwright Chromium can launch, then promote the current “prepared assertion” documentation to executed aerospace workflow-smoke evidence if the metadata assertions pass.

  Build a bounded aerospace-local consumer for the existing USGS geomagnetism backend context source, keep it contextual-only, and preserve export metadata.
- What changed:
  Added typed client contracts and a dedicated `useUsgsGeomagnetismContextQuery(...)` hook for the existing `/api/context/geomagnetism/usgs` backend route.
  Added a pure aerospace helper that summarizes observatory, source mode, source health/state, sample interval, latest sample time, selected elements, latest values, and contextual caveats without implying avionics, GPS, radio, aircraft, or satellite failure.
  Wired the geomagnetism consumer into the aerospace inspector as a compact `Geomagnetism (USGS)` section, and preserved compact snapshot/export metadata under `geomagnetismContext`.
  Integrated geomagnetism into aerospace operational-context and availability accounting so it is treated as optional global context rather than target-specific truth.
  Updated aerospace docs and source-contract docs to describe the new contextual consumer, export metadata, and no-inference caveats.

- Blockers or caveats:
  Focused aerospace Playwright smoke on this Windows host is still launcher-blocked by the previously documented Playwright `spawn EPERM` environment issue, so the new geomagnetism consumer is validated through types, lint/build, and existing backend contracts rather than executed browser smoke on this machine.
  Geomagnetism remains contextual-only and optional. It is observatory magnetic-field context, not target-position truth and not evidence of downstream avionics, GPS, radio, aircraft, or satellite failure.
- Next recommended task:
  When Playwright launch is available on a healthy host, extend the aerospace smoke metadata assertions to confirm `geomagnetismContext` presence and the geomagnetism inspector/export lines in an executed end-to-end aerospace smoke run.

- Task:
  Add an aerospace-local context issue/review summary feature on top of the existing source stack, keep it export-aware, and document its trust/coverage caveats.
- What changed:
  Added a new pure frontend helper that builds a compact aerospace context review summary from already-loaded operational-context, availability, selected-target data-health, and OpenSky comparison inputs.
  The new summary surfaces attention and informational review notes for degraded source health, unavailable expected context, empty optional source windows, fixture-mode context, stale or unknown selected-target freshness, derived evidence basis, and guarded OpenSky comparison states without implying impact, intent, or causation.
  Wired the summary into the aerospace inspector as a compact `Aerospace Context Review` section and into snapshot/export metadata as `aerospaceContextIssues`.
  Updated aerospace export-profile footer prioritization so existing export profiles can surface one or two compact review lines without discarding full machine-readable metadata.

  Aerospace workflow-smoke execution on this Windows host is still launcher-blocked by the previously documented Playwright `spawn EPERM` environment issue, so the new review-summary UI/export behavior is validated by lint/build and existing backend contracts rather than executed browser smoke on this machine.
  The initial lint/build attempt from the repo root failed only because `package.json` lives under `app/client`; rerunning from the correct client workspace passed cleanly.
- Next recommended task:
  When Playwright launch is available on a healthy Windows host, extend the existing aerospace smoke metadata assertions to confirm `aerospaceContextIssues` presence and the compact review footer lines in an executed end-to-end smoke run.

  Confirmed the smoke harness did not reach browser assertions on this Windows host because Playwright Chromium launch failed up front with `spawn EPERM`, which the runner already classifies as a machine-environment launcher issue rather than an aerospace assertion failure.
  Updated the aerospace workflow-validation and source-contract docs to replace the stale Connect-owned build/smoke blocker wording with the current launcher-environment-specific blocker, and added the same local execution note to the aircraft/satellite smoke checklist.

  [aerospace-source-contract-matrix.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/aerospace-source-contract-matrix.md)

  [aerospace-ai.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/agent-progress/aerospace-ai.md)
- Validation:
  `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` ran and failed before assertions with Playwright launch `spawn EPERM`; runner diagnosis: `windows-playwright-launch-permission`.
  `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_swpc_contracts.py app/server/tests/test_cneos_contracts.py app/server/tests/test_opensky_contracts.py app/server/tests/test_aviation_weather_contracts.py app/server/tests/test_faa_nas_status_contracts.py -q` passed (`26 passed`).
  `python -m compileall app/server/src` passed.
- Blockers or caveats:
  The remaining aerospace workflow-validation gap is executed browser smoke evidence on a host where Playwright can launch successfully.
  This pass intentionally avoided frontend/shared files, AppShell, InspectorPanel, LayerPanel, and Playwright script edits outside documentation because the assignment was docs/smoke-status hardening only.
- Next recommended task:
  Re-run `python app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py aerospace` on a Windows environment where Playwright Chromium launch is allowed, then update the aerospace workflow docs from launcher-blocked to executed workflow-smoke evidence if the metadata assertions pass.

- Task:
  Backend/docs-only aerospace contract hardening pass for existing AWC, FAA NAS, CNEOS, SWPC, and OpenSky source slices.
- What changed:
  Added a dedicated aerospace source contract matrix documenting route shape, evidence basis, health/mode fields, empty behavior, export metadata keys, smoke status, caveats, and do-not-infer rules for all five aerospace source slices.
  Expanded the aerospace workflow validation doc with explicit backend contract coverage, required contract caveats, and the remaining workflow evidence that still depends on Connect-owned build/smoke health.
  Tightened backend contract coverage by asserting guardrail caveats directly in FAA NAS, AWC, CNEOS, SWPC, and OpenSky tests, plus explicit OpenSky empty-result and non-replacement coverage.

  `python -m compileall app/server/src` passed.
- Blockers or caveats:
  End-to-end aerospace smoke execution still depends on Connect-owned frontend build/smoke health in shared environmental/inspector typing. This pass intentionally did not touch frontend/shared files.
- Next recommended task:
  Once Connect restores shared frontend build/smoke health, run the aerospace Playwright metadata assertions and update the workflow-validation docs from “assertions added” to “workflow-validated in executed smoke”.

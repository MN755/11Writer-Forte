# Marine Context Fixture Reference

Marine subsystem only. This guide documents the deterministic fixture behavior used by the current marine context-source contracts and backend tests.

Purpose:
- make fixture expectations explicit
- keep backend contract assertions aligned with fixture intent
- prevent casual changes to evidence basis, caveats, empty behavior, or disabled-mode semantics

Related docs:
- [marine-context-source-contract-matrix.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/marine-context-source-contract-matrix.md)
- [marine-workflow-validation.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/marine-workflow-validation.md)

## Fixture Principles

Shared across all current marine context sources:
- fixture mode is deterministic and local
- fixture mode must remain explicit in source-health/source-mode fields
- empty/no-match is a valid result, not an error
- caveats are required
- context sources do not imply vessel behavior, intent, anomaly cause, pollution impact, or health risk
- fixture mode may emit `stale` only when returned observation/update timestamps honestly age past the source freshness threshold
- fixture mode may emit `unavailable` only when the backend source-retrieval step fails
- fixture mode may emit `degraded` only when returned records carry real partial-metadata evidence

## NOAA CO-OPS

Route:
- `GET /api/marine/context/noaa-coops`

Fixture mode behavior:
- `sourceHealth.sourceMode=fixture`
- `sourceHealth.enabled=true`
- `sourceHealth.health=loaded` when at least one station matches radius
- `sourceHealth.health=empty` when no station matches radius
- `sourceHealth.health=stale` when returned station observation timestamps age beyond the 30-minute freshness threshold
- `sourceHealth.health=unavailable` when fixture source retrieval fails inside the backend service path

Representative fixture records:
- water-level-only station
  - example: Galveston Pier 21
- current-only station
  - example: Galveston Bay Entrance North Jetty
- mixed station with both products
  - example: San Francisco
- additional water-level coastal station
  - example: Vaca Key / Florida Bay

Evidence basis expectations:
- `latestWaterLevel.observedBasis=observed`
- `latestCurrent.observedBasis=observed`

Expected caveats:
- source-level caveat describing fixture/local mode and environmental-only usage
- response-level caveats warning against intent inference from tides/currents
- station-level caveats warning against overgeneralizing station-local conditions

Empty/no-match behavior:
- no nearby station match returns:
  - `count=0`
  - `stations=[]`
  - `sourceHealth.health=empty`

Missing optional field cases:
- water-level-only station omits current observation
- current-only station omits water-level observation

Disabled mode behavior:
- non-fixture mode returns:
  - `count=0`
  - `stations=[]`
  - `sourceHealth.health=disabled`
  - `sourceHealth.enabled=false`
  - explicit fixture-first caveat

What this fixture protects against:
- regression from `empty` to error semantics on no nearby station
- loss of mixed/water-only/current-only product coverage
- accidental removal of caveats
- accidental change from observed evidence basis
- accidental fabrication of live behavior in non-fixture mode
- accidental loss of timestamp-based stale classification
- accidental removal of honest retrieval-failure `unavailable` handling

## Fixture Regression Checklist

Do not remove:
- empty result case for CO-OPS
- empty result case for NDBC
- empty result case for Scottish Water
- empty result case for Vigicrues hydrometry
- empty result case for Ireland OPW water level
- empty result case for Netherlands RWS Waterinfo
- empty result case for USCG NAVTEX Broadcast Notices
- empty result case for GEBCO Gridded Bathymetry
- Scottish Water partial-metadata record
- Vigicrues partial-metadata record
- Ireland OPW partial-metadata record
- Netherlands RWS Waterinfo partial-metadata record
- Netherlands RWS Waterinfo prompt-like inert-metadata record
- USCG NAVTEX partial-metadata record
- GEBCO bounded shelf/offshore sample set
- source-level caveat fields
- event/station-level caveat fields where currently present

Do not change casually:
- CO-OPS `observed` evidence basis
- NDBC `observed` evidence basis
- Scottish Water `source-reported` evidence basis
- Vigicrues hydrometry `observed` evidence basis
- Ireland OPW water level `observed` evidence basis
- Netherlands RWS Waterinfo `observed` evidence basis
- USCG NAVTEX `advisory` evidence basis
- GEBCO Gridded Bathymetry `contextual` evidence basis
- disabled/non-fixture behavior
- fixture/local source-mode explicitness
- water-height vs flow separation
- current timestamp-based stale thresholds
- current no-fabrication boundary for `unavailable` source-health states
- current no-fabrication boundary for `degraded` source-health states on CO-OPS and NDBC
- current no-fabrication boundary for `degraded` source-health on GEBCO
- message-family separation for NAVTEX warning subjects

## Fusion / Review Fixture Expectations

The marine context fusion summary and marine context review report do not have their own backend fixtures. They inherit deterministic behavior from the source fixtures above.

What these inherited fixtures protect against:
- fusion/review helpers always receive explicit source-mode and source-health fields
- empty/no-match context remains distinguishable from disabled mode
- caveat lines remain available for cross-family review output
- observed vs source-reported evidence basis remains intact when marine-local helpers summarize source families

What this guide does not claim:
- no dedicated backend fixture exists for `contextFusionSummary`
- no dedicated backend fixture exists for `contextReviewReport`
- smoke/build confirmation for those frontend-local summaries remains a separate layer from backend fixture guarantees
- Netherlands RWS Waterinfo, USCG NAVTEX, and GEBCO now all have marine-local consumer and smoke metadata coverage in addition to backend fixture guarantees

If a fixture behavior changes:
- update backend contract tests first
- update [marine-context-source-contract-matrix.md](/C:/Users/mike/11Writer/app/docs/marine-context-source-contract-matrix.md)
- update this reference guide in the same change

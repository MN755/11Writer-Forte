# Consolidated No-Auth Source Registry

Last updated:
- `2026-04-30 America/Chicago`

Maintainer note:
- This is a human-readable consolidated registry of approved source candidates and rejected source families.
- `approved` means approved as a source candidate or backlog item. It does not mean implemented, workflow-validated, live-validated, or production-ready.
- Operational implementation status remains in `source-assignment-board.md`, `source-validation-status.md`, and source-specific progress docs.

## Approval Rule

A source is approved only when Codex/backend code can integrate it without user account work:

- no account, API key, token, OAuth, app ID, email registration, request form, manual approval, CAPTCHA, or anti-bot wall
- machine-readable by normal backend HTTP or public object storage access
- public-only endpoints when a provider mixes public and login-only data
- authoritative, official, scientific, open-data, or clearly labeled community/crowd context
- compatible with source mode, source health, evidence basis, caveats, and export metadata
- no scraping of commercial dashboards, app-only pages, tokenized viewer calls, or brittle session endpoints

Guardrails are allowed. Some approved sources are approved only for a public sub-feed, public bucket, public GTFS feed, public Atom feed, public ArcGIS/OpenData dataset, or one bounded OGC/download family.

- Media, vendor, and blog feeds are contextual awareness only.
- Official advisory feeds remain advisory unless the source explicitly states observed incident details.
- Do not scrape linked article pages without separate source approval.
- Do not start runtime polling with all 52 feeds; build the generic parser and source-health model first.

## Not Approved / Rejected Sources

### Rejected From Original Screening

| Source | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| OpenCorporates | Access, rate, and terms uncertainty; not clean enough as a no-auth core source. |
| PhishTank | Serious usage strongly pushes registration/key behavior. |
| OpenPhish | Commercial or limited-access uncertainty. |
| MarineTraffic scraping | Licensing, rate-limit, and scraping risk. |
| VesselFinder scraping | Licensing, rate-limit, and scraping risk. |
| Random GitHub public API lists | Discovery only; not production-trust sources. |

### Rejected Generic Categories

| Category | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Generic all-state DOT feeds | Too inconsistent; approve only specific public endpoints. |
| NIFC/EGP sources requiring AGOL login | Login wall. |
| Utility outage maps without confirmed public machine endpoints | Often app/viewer-only or tokenized. |
| Viewer-only web apps | Not backend-pullable. |
| App-only endpoints | Too brittle and likely hidden-access dependent. |
| CAPTCHA-protected sources | Violates no-auth machine access. |
| Tokenized session endpoints | Not stable no-auth access. |
| Request-form datasets | Manual access step required. |
| Login-only portals | Violates no-login rule. |
| Scraped commercial trackers | Legal, terms, and rate-limit risk. |

## Use Rules

- Do not treat this document as implementation proof.
- Do not promote any source to `implemented`, `workflow-validated`, `validated`, or `fully validated` from this document alone.
- Check `source-assignment-board.md` before assigning or implementing a source.
- Check source-specific briefs before coding a connector.
- Preserve provenance, caveats, source health, evidence basis, and export metadata in every source-backed workflow.

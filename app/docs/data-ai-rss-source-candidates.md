# Data AI RSS Source Candidates

Last verified:
- `2026-04-30 America/Chicago`

Purpose:
- Seed the new Data AI lane with public, no-auth RSS/Atom feeds for cybersecurity, internet infrastructure, world news, and world events.
- These are source candidates/backlog items. They are not implemented, validated workflows, or production-ready connectors.

Validation method:
- Normal backend-style HTTP request with a clear `User-Agent`
- HTTP 200 response
- XML parsed as RSS, Atom, or RDF
- Feed item/entry count greater than zero at verification time

Additional validated feed batch:
- `app/docs/data-ai-rss-source-candidates-batch2.md`
- 115 more working RSS/Atom/RDF feeds validated on `2026-04-30 America/Chicago`
- `app/docs/data-ai-rss-source-candidates-batch3.md`
- 110 more working RSS/Atom/RDF feeds validated on `2026-04-30 America/Chicago`
- Data AI now has 277 validated feed candidates across the first list, Batch 2, and Batch 3.

General ingestion rules:
- Preserve feed URL, final URL after redirects, source name, source category, published timestamp, fetched timestamp, GUID/link, title, summary, source health, and caveats.
- Treat official advisory/event feeds as advisory or observed-by-source, depending on source semantics.
- Treat media, vendor, and blog feeds as contextual awareness only, not ground truth.
- Do not scrape pages linked from feed items unless a separate no-auth machine-readable source is approved.
- Use conservative polling, ETag/Last-Modified where available, and backoff on errors.
- Deduplicate by GUID first, canonical link second, content hash third.

## First Data AI Implementation Slice

Recommended first implementation:

- Add a generic RSS/Atom/RDF feed adapter with fixture-first parsing.
- Use 5 feeds only for the first code slice:
  - `cisa-cybersecurity-advisories`
  - `cisa-ics-advisories`
  - `sans-isc-diary`
  - `cloudflare-status`
  - `gdacs-alerts`
- Normalize into one `DataFeedItem` contract:
  - `sourceId`
  - `sourceName`
  - `sourceCategory`
  - `feedUrl`
  - `finalUrl`
  - `guid`
  - `link`
  - `title`
  - `summary`
  - `publishedAt`
  - `fetchedAt`
  - `evidenceBasis`
  - `sourceMode`
  - `sourceHealth`
  - `caveats`
  - `tags`

Do not:
- start with all 52 feeds in runtime polling
- use article body scraping
- infer severity from title keywords alone
- treat media reports as confirmed official events
- mix cybersecurity and world-news scoring into one severity scale

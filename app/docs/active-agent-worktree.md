# Active Agent Worktree

## Current state

- Branch: `main`
- The local worktree is currently dirty and mixed across multiple active agents.
- During active parallel work, do not stage, commit, push, reset, or stash unless the user explicitly authorizes that step.
- Do not use `git add .` in this repository while multiple agent lanes are active.
- Use `app/docs/commit-groups.current.md` when planning future task-by-task commit consolidation.
- Use `app/docs/source-fusion-reporting-input-inventory.md` when deconflicting the emerging reporting-desk / fusion-input wave.
- Use `app/docs/reporting-loop-package-contract.md` plus `cmd /c npm.cmd run test:reporting-loop-package-contract` when extending shared reporting-loop packages without widening UI or semantics.
- Use `app/docs/source-onboarding-contract.md` when evaluating incoming source waves so auth posture, machine-usability posture, fixture-first expectations, cache/request-budget rules, and prompt-injection-safe free-text handling stay consistent across lanes.
- Use `app/docs/phase3-handoffs/connect-ai.md` for the current Connect cutover summary before doing shared integration, runtime-boundary, release-readiness, or scanner cleanup work in Phase 3 chats.
- Use `python scripts/list_changed_files_by_owner.py` for a quick heuristic ownership scan before staging. It does not replace manual diff review.
- Use `python scripts/list_changed_files_by_owner.py --summary` for a concise branch/worktree snapshot with ownership counts, shared-file warnings, and coordination doc links.
- The scanner now also classifies many lane-owned source docs, backend services, tests, and fixtures for Geospatial, Marine, Aerospace, Features/Webcam, Data AI, Gather, Connect workflow paths, and a dedicated `atlas-planning` bucket for user-directed Atlas planning docs.
- Latest Connect handoff-prep checkpoint for assignment `2026-05-05 23:58 America/Chicago`:
  - this was a docs-only finish-up pass
  - no new compile, lint, or build run was needed because no executable/shared runtime code changed
  - the handoff doc now lives at:
    - `app/docs/phase3-handoffs/connect-ai.md`
  - narrow live-state read during the handoff pass showed:
    - branch still `main...origin/main`
    - `modified=126`
    - `untracked=110`
    - `shared-high-collision: 8`
    - `unknown: 61`
  - `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json` reported `11` open low-priority alerts:
    - `Atlas AI: 9`
    - `Manager AI: 2`
  - interpretation:
    - latest green shared validation still anchors to the `2026-05-05 20:22 America/Chicago` checkpoint
    - the newer counts above describe live mixed-tree posture only
    - the repo is not consolidation-ready
- Latest Connect checkpoint for assignment `2026-05-05 20:22 America/Chicago`:
  - `git status --short --branch` passed
  - `python scripts/list_changed_files_by_owner.py --summary` passed before and after the scanner cleanup
  - `python scripts/release_dry_run.py --json` remains advisory-red because the tree is mixed and heuristic token-pattern checks still match `settings.py`, `status_service.py`, and `test_source_discovery_memory.py`; this is not confirmed live-secret leakage by itself
  - `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json` passed and reported `9` open low-priority alerts:
    - `Atlas AI: 8`
    - `Manager AI: 1`
  - `python -m compileall app/server/src` passed
  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint` passed
  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` passed
  - no shared compile, type, import, lint, or build blocker reproduced
  - shared contract truth:
    - the typed API surfaces already carry bounded contracts for `cisa-kev`, `rdap`, `crtsh`, `nws-alerts`, and `noaa-nowcoast-ogc`
    - no shared type or route-contract rewrite was needed in this pass
  - scanner cleanup reduced only clear new-wave ambiguity:
    - `unknown` dropped from `54` to `27`
    - Data AI now cleanly owns `cisa-kev`, `rdap`, `crtsh`, and the bounded `internet_context` route family
    - Geospatial now cleanly owns `nws-alerts` and `noaa-nowcoast-ogc`
    - Aerospace now cleanly owns `gpsjam`
    - Features/Webcam now cleanly owns the OSM lead-discovery and OSM lead-review-reconciliation packets
    - Gather now cleanly owns `source-user-priority-routing-governance-packet.md`
  - current live snapshot after the cleanup:
    - `modified=110`
    - `untracked=82`
    - `shared-high-collision: 8`
    - `unknown: 27`
  - remaining `unknown` files are still intentionally broad/shared:
    - shared Source Discovery runtime and eval surfaces
    - shared runtime/media surfaces
    - broad planning docs
    - `app/client/package.json`
    - local runtime artifact folders under `app/server/data/model-cache/` and `app/server/data/runtime-user/`
  - current bounded peer/runtime truth remains:
    - discovery, browser-only, and runtime-only surfaces stay below implementation proof
    - Source Discovery runtime and eval surfaces remain shared/runtime infrastructure rather than lane-local source validation proof
    - Atlas media-geolocation hardening remains derived-evidence and runtime-quality scaffolding only

  - `python -m compileall app/server/src` passed
  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint` passed
  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` passed
  - no shared product-code blocker reproduced in this pass
  - new bounded shared support surface:
    - `app/docs/source-onboarding-contract.md`
  - current role of that new contract:
    - one neutral intake/onboarding layer for auth posture, machine-usability posture, fixture-first expectations, source-mode and source-health honesty, request-budget and cache posture, export-safe expectations, and prompt-injection-safe free-text handling
  - current bounded peer/runtime truth remains:
    - browser-only, discovery-only, and runtime-only surfaces stay below implementation proof
    - Wonder archive-index, mailing-list archive, directory-root, Stack Exchange, Statuspage, and Mastodon discovery remain candidate/review/runtime only
    - Wonder seed-packet lineage remains explainability metadata only

  - `python scripts/release_dry_run.py --json` remains advisory-red because the tree is mixed and heuristic token-pattern checks still match `settings.py` plus `test_source_discovery_memory.py`; this is not confirmed live-secret leakage by itself
  - `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json` passed and reported `6` open low-priority alerts:
    - `Atlas AI: 6`
  - `python -m compileall app/server/src` failed once on an indentation error in `app/server/src/services/source_discovery_service.py`, then passed after the smallest safe syntax-only fix
  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint` passed
  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` passed
  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run test:reporting-loop-package-contract` passed after the shared regression was extended
  - `python scripts/validation_snapshot.py --compile passed --lint passed --build passed` passed
  - no shared product-code lint or build blocker reproduced beyond the Source Discovery indentation break
  - the shared reporting-loop compatibility surface now validates:
    - Aerospace fusion snapshot, report brief, current-awareness digest, VAAC advisory report package, and reporting handoff contract
    - Data AI fusion snapshot, report brief, current-awareness digest, topic-safe report export packet, and question briefing packet
    - Marine fusion snapshot, report brief, and current-awareness digest
  - ownership ambiguity reduced only where it stayed obvious and durable:

    - Wonder seed-packet lineage remains explainability metadata only

- Latest live ownership snapshot from the current reporting-loop compatibility pass:
  - historical mixed-wave snapshots above `100` changed files were real at the time and came from pre-cleanup multi-agent state, not from a scanner bug
  - the current repo is no longer that broad mixed wave, but it is also not fully clean
  - within the current `2026-05-05 18:15 America/Chicago` Connect checkpoint:
    - the first live scan showed `modified=17`, `untracked=3`, `shared-high-collision: 1`, `unknown: 6`
    - later in the same sweep, additional concurrent lane edits landed and the refreshed scan showed `modified=38`, `untracked=8`, `shared-high-collision: 4`, `unknown: 0`
  - current interpretation:
    - earlier `118/89` style counts should be treated as historical mixed-wave truth
    - the current live repo is a much smaller coordination plus shared-runtime slice that can still move while agents are active
- Latest Connect checkpoint for assignment `2026-05-05 18:33 America/Chicago`:
  - `git status --short --branch` passed
  - `python scripts/list_changed_files_by_owner.py --summary` passed and, after current live-slice cleanup, reported:

    - Atlas media-geolocation hardening remains derived-evidence and runtime-quality scaffolding only
    - Wonder Statuspage and Mastodon discovery remain bounded public-discovery/runtime surfaces only

- The latest scanner run reported:
  - `unknown: 8`
  - `shared-high-collision: 5`
- Latest Connect checkpoint for assignment `2026-05-05 18:15 America/Chicago`:
  - `git status --short --branch` passed
  - `python scripts/list_changed_files_by_owner.py --summary` passed twice during the sweep:
    - initial live checkpoint:
      - `modified=17`
      - `untracked=3`
      - `shared-high-collision: 1`
      - `unknown: 6`

      - `untracked=8`
      - `shared-high-collision: 4`
      - `unknown: 0`
  - `python scripts/release_dry_run.py --json` remains advisory-red because the repo is not clean and `settings.py` still trips heuristic token-pattern checks
  - `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py --json` passed and reported `5` open low-priority alerts owned by `Atlas AI`

  - `cmd /c npm.cmd run test:reporting-loop-package-contract` passed
  - `python scripts/validation_snapshot.py --compile passed --lint passed --build passed` passed
  - no shared compile, import, lint, or build blocker reproduced
  - one scanner-only blocker was reproduced and fixed:
    - `scripts/list_changed_files_by_owner.py` briefly had a malformed boolean expression during Connect-owned noise reduction
    - fixed immediately and reran scanner plus dry run successfully
  - current peer/runtime classification truth:
    - Wonder Stack Exchange queryless roots and seed-packet lineage remain candidate/review discovery infrastructure only
    - Atlas media-geolocation hardening remains derived-evidence and runtime-quality scaffolding only
    - Wonder Statuspage and Mastodon discovery remain bounded public-discovery/runtime surfaces only
    - local `app/server/.venv-win/` is a local runtime artifact, not implementation proof or commit material

  - `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_environmental_fusion_snapshot_input.py -q` passed
  - `python scripts/validation_snapshot.py --compile passed --lint passed --build passed` passed
  - one current shared blocker reproduced and was fixed:
    - `marineCorridorSituationPackage.ts` was incorrectly calling `.find()` directly on the `explain` section object instead of `explain.lines`
    - the fix was type-only and did not change Marine semantics
  - new reporting-loop compatibility truth:
    - `app/docs/reporting-loop-package-contract.md` now distinguishes first-class fusion/report-brief peers from adjacent reporting/support packages
    - the focused client regression now validates current Aerospace, Data AI, and Marine package surfaces plus the Aerospace VAAC advisory report package against that neutral minimum without changing semantics
    - backend environmental fusion snapshot input remains a first-class server-side peer and passed its dedicated route test
    - backend webcam sandbox/source-ops reporting helpers remain adjacent reporting/support surfaces rather than first-class reporting-loop peers
  - peer/runtime classification truth:
    - Atlas media geolocation remains derived-evidence and candidate-location scaffolding only
    - Wonder Statuspage and Mastodon discovery remain bounded public-discovery/runtime surfaces only
  - the tree remains validation-green but not consolidation-ready:
    - top manual hunk-review files still include `AppShell.tsx`, `InspectorPanel.tsx`, `queries.ts`, `settings.py`, and `api.py`
- The Atlas runtime operator console slice touched shared backend, runtime, frontend shell, docs, and tests.
- Connect validated the shared boundaries for that slice, but it should still be treated as partially validated peer input rather than full runtime-proof:
  - runtime path resolver exists
  - Source Discovery runtime worker and service action routes exist
  - Wave LLM review listing route exists
  - the client operator panel imports and builds
  - no dedicated operator end-to-end validation exists in the current sweep
- Use `python scripts/release_dry_run.py` for a larger non-mutating readiness scan covering ownership groups, high-collision files, secret/junk checks, generated-file checks, and validation guidance.
- Use `python scripts/validation_snapshot.py --compile passed --lint passed --build passed --smoke marine=passed --smoke aerospace=known-local-caveat:windows-browser-launch-permission --smoke webcam=passed` for a compact manager-facing validation and smoke summary.
- Use `python scripts/alerts_ledger.py` for a compact manager-facing alerts summary and ledger validation.
- Treat scanner output as commit-planning guidance, not absolute ownership truth. Shared and high-collision files still require manual diff review.

  - the current stale-vs-real `AppShell.tsx` mismatch pattern reported by Data AI did not reproduce in the live tree
  - `app/docs/source-fusion-reporting-input-inventory.md` was created to record the current fusion/reporting-input surfaces
  - current fusion/reporting-input truth:
    - Aerospace already has bounded evidence-timeline, package-coherence, workflow-validation, and fusion-snapshot input surfaces
    - Data AI already has bounded source-intelligence, fusion snapshot, infrastructure-status, topic-lens, and long-tail discovery posture surfaces
    - Marine already has bounded evidence summary, context fusion/reporting, corridor review, and source-health export workflow surfaces
    - Base Earth / environmental reference context already has bounded export-package and review-queue surfaces, now including RGI glacier inventory context
  - current runtime-boundary truth:
    - Source Discovery, Wave LLM, media evidence, and analyst workbench are implemented shared runtime/review infrastructure
    - they remain bounded review/runtime surfaces rather than full reporting-desk proof
  - current stale source-suggestion truth:
    - `propublica`, `global-voices`, `geonet-geohazards`, and `hko-open-weather` should not be routed as fresh next-wave source builds where repo truth already shows implementation or superseded routing

  - no current repo-wide blocker remained reproduced
  - one earlier runtime-suite failure was observed once in the same assignment:
    - `SourceDiscoverySchedulerTickResponse` validation complained that `publicDiscoveryJobsCompleted` was missing
    - immediate code inspection and direct route repro showed the live route/service/model path already returns that field
    - the full shared runtime suite then reran cleanly with no source edit
    - treat that earlier failure as stale or concurrent-tree drift, not as current broken runtime behavior
  - current shared runtime boundary truth:
    - Source Discovery now includes real bounded structure-scan, public-discovery, knowledge-backfill, review-claim import/apply, and media fetch/OCR/interpret routes and service paths
    - knowledge nodes and duplicate-aware clustering exist, but remain corroboration/accounting helpers rather than proof of event truth
    - reviewed-claim application remains explicit, audit-logged, and review-gated
    - Wave LLM provider-management/config surfaces are implemented, but remain config-gated/runtime-boundary truth rather than validation-proof of live provider usage
    - live provider execution still requires provider configuration, explicit network permission, and positive request budget
    - media artifact fetch, OCR, and interpretation paths exist as bounded/gated scaffolding; broader autonomous media ingestion was not reproduced
  - current Data AI routing truth:
    - newer coordination docs already say not to route `propublica` or `global-voices` as fresh next-wave feed work
    - some older packet/history docs still mention them and should be treated as superseded planning artifacts, not current routing truth

    - article fetch is explicit through `POST /api/source-discovery/jobs/article-fetch` and is gated to reviewed source classes and allowed lifecycle states
    - social metadata collection is explicit through `POST /api/source-discovery/jobs/social-metadata`, stores metadata-only snapshots, and does not fetch private/media-heavy content
    - source packet export is explicit through `GET /api/source-discovery/memory/{source_id}/export`
    - review actions remain explicit through `POST /api/source-discovery/review/actions`
    - reviewed-claim application is explicit through `POST /api/source-discovery/reviews/apply-claims`, requires reviewed inputs, and is audit-logged

  - current source-discovery/runtime-boundary truth:
    - `source_discovery` is a real persistent SQLite-backed shared-memory family, not a planning-only placeholder
    - current routes support memory overview plus API-triggered candidate upserts and claim-outcome writes
    - Wave Monitor now seeds that shared source-memory store from its source-candidate rows
    - no autonomous source promotion, trust approval, or background polling loop reproduced
  - current ownership recommendation:
    - keep Wave Monitor, Source Discovery, and Analyst Workbench broad/shared for now
    - do not hide those shared families with cosmetic scanner rules
    - treat them as explicit consolidation-review territory until Manager AI or the user routes stable ownership
- Current Phase 2 acceleration risk note:
  - the validation surface is green, but the worktree is still heavily mixed
  - shared high-collision files remain active in `AppShell.tsx`, `InspectorPanel.tsx`, `queries.ts`, `api.ts`, `settings.py`, `types/api.py`, and the smoke harness
  - a small residual `unknown` bucket is acceptable, but if it starts growing again during rapid source expansion, treat that as commit-planning debt and refresh the ownership scanner before any consolidation push
- Phase 2 checkpoint:
  - the current broad validation surface is green for compile, client lint/build, representative Geospatial, Marine, Features/Webcam, Aerospace, and Data AI backend tests, plus focused `marine` and `webcam` smoke
  - the newest validated source wave includes GeoSphere Austria warnings, NASA POWER meteorology/solar context, Washington VAAC advisories, and the latest webcam source-ops detail/export rollups
  - Data AI now has a dedicated ownership bucket for its first implementation wave, covering the CISA advisories slice, FIRST EPSS slice, and the bounded five-feed aggregate route while leaving the older generic RSS foundation outside that lane-specific bucket
  - on the current live dirty set, the ownership scanner is reporting:
    - `shared-high-collision: 8`
    - `unknown: 2`
  - the earlier high-priority cross-platform coordination alert has been consumed into agent next-task docs; the alerts ledger is currently back to zero open alerts
  - the previously reported `AppShell.tsx` `selectedTargetSummary` build blocker did not reproduce in the latest Connect sweep
  - `app/docs/data-ai-rss-source-candidates.md` is planning input from Atlas AI, not implementation or validation proof and not a mandate to ingest all listed feeds
  - `app/docs/data-ai-rss-source-candidates-batch3.md` is also Atlas planning input only and now classifies under the dedicated `atlas-planning` bucket rather than disappearing into lane-implementation ownership
  - Atlas runtime-planning docs are architecture input only right now; they still require future implementation validation before any runtime-mode, packaging, pairing/auth, or companion-access work is treated as executed product behavior
  - if future mixed work pushes the residual `unknown` bucket back up again, treat that as commit-planning debt and refresh the scanner before any consolidation push
  - latest Connect checkpoint truth:
    - the latest full Connect checkpoint reached a clean local tree on `main...origin/main` before subsequent concurrent lane edits resumed
    - that clean checkpoint had `shared-high-collision: 0` and `unknown: 0`
    - the focused validation checkpoint for Data AI, Geospatial reference/seismic, Aerospace NCEI, Features/Webcam source-ops, and Marine source-health was green

      - persistent SQLite-backed source-memory store is implemented
      - candidate upserts, claim-outcome writes, seed-url jobs, health checks, bounded expansion jobs, content snapshots, reputation reversal, and manual scheduler ticks are implemented
      - bounded expansion creates review candidates only and does not fetch child sources
      - scheduler tick currently performs bounded health checks only; no autonomous promotion, trust approval, or hidden polling loop was reproduced
    - current warning status:
      - `test_source_discovery_memory.py` now covers the five-part backend slice and passed with `10` tests

      - analyst workbench route/service/test/doc surfaces

    - current residual `unknown` now includes broad analyst-workbench, risk-context, water-quality, and README/app wiring surfaces
    - analyst workbench should remain explicitly broad/unknown for now because it composes Geospatial plus Data AI plus shared typed API surfaces and does not yet have a clearly isolated owner
    - Data AI `Assignment version: 2026-05-01 12:33 America/Chicago` remains in flight unless/until the Data progress doc records completion

      - `source-quick-assign-packets-data-ai-rss.md`
      - `7Po8/`
      - `7po8-integration-plan.md`
    - keep Analyst Workbench broad/unknown:
      - current route/service/test/doc surfaces still compose Data AI, Geospatial, and shared route/API wiring
      - it is not honest to force it into Connect or Data ownership yet
    - keep cross-source hypothesis graph as planning context:
      - current doc is safe `atlas-planning`, not implementation proof
      - the first safe implementation slice should be bounded shared contract scaffolding only, with later lane-specific population and Phase 3 UI integration
    - new `wave_monitor` preview route/service/type/test surfaces are also broad/shared for now and should remain visible rather than being force-classified cosmetically

    - current Wave Monitor recommendation:
      - keep `wave_monitor` route/service/type/test plus related Analyst Workbench integration broad/shared for now
      - Connect owns validation and release-readiness visibility only, not Wave Monitor feature semantics
      - do not mount standalone 7Po8 runtime, do not add scheduler/autonomous behavior, and do not force-route the current preview family into a single lane just to reduce `unknown`

## Progress doc rule

- Every agent must maintain its own progress doc under `app/docs/agent-progress/`.
- After each assigned task, the agent's final output must be appended there as well as reported in chat.
- Manager AI should treat those progress docs as the first-stop local record for:
  - latest completed work
  - validation status
  - blockers
  - recommended next task
- Keep newest entries at the top so the current state is visible without scrolling through archaeology.
- Required per-entry fields:
  - timestamp
  - task or mission
  - assignment version read
  - what changed
  - files touched
  - validation run
  - blockers or caveats
  - next recommended task

## Alerts doc rule

- Every agent must also use `app/docs/alerts.md` for one-line coordination alerts.
- Read the alerts doc during new-chat startup and during any check-in-sensitive handoff.
- Use alerts only when the item cannot be cleanly handled inside the agent's own lane, or when Manager AI needs to know the lane is waiting for reassignment.
- Acceptable alert cases:
  - new agent chat created and synced
  - task completed and awaiting Manager reassignment
  - shared-file or shared-validation conflict
  - ownership conflict
  - unresolved repo-wide blocker
  - unresolved safety or policy ambiguity
- Do not log every little implementation wobble. If the agent can fix it safely alone, it should fix it instead of writing an alert.
- Keep the alerts file at about 500 total lines by removing the oldest `completed` lines first.

## Next task doc rule

- Every agent must maintain its own next-task doc under `app/docs/agent-next-tasks/`.
- Next-task docs are single-assignment files, not history logs.
- Rewrite the whole file when assigning the next task.
- Keep only the active assignment in the file.
- Every next-task doc should include an explicit `Assignment version:` line so the agent can acknowledge exactly which task revision it read.
- When Manager AI has changed workflow, policy, roadmap, architecture, validation, or safety guidance relevant to that agent, the next-task doc should also include a concise `Recent Manager/Workflow Updates:` block near the top.
- If an agent does not currently have work, the entire file should say that no active task is assigned and the agent should wait for Manager AI.
- Manager AI owns rewriting next-task docs during check-ins after reviewing the latest progress docs.
- Data AI follows this normal Manager-controlled next-task workflow. Atlas AI remains the exception because it is user-directed.

## Manager broadcast policy

- Major coordination changes should not stay trapped in chat.
- Manager AI must broadcast relevant workflow or policy changes in the next prompt given to affected agents.
- Broadcast the change briefly, not as a full project-history dump.
- If the change affects multiple lanes, also update the durable repo docs that govern that behavior.
- Agents should treat the update block in the next-task doc as active guidance, not optional commentary.

## No-idle rule

- If assignable work exists, Manager AI should not leave agents idle.
- Small adjacent tasks should be bundled into one larger coherent assignment when practical to reduce user relay overhead.
- Phase 2 bias:
  - prioritize new source slices
  - prioritize new feature slices
  - prioritize documentation that makes Phase 3 consolidation easier
- Avoid parking agents on polish-only work when source or feature expansion is available and safe.

## Check-in workflow

1. One or more agents finish tasks and append final outputs to their progress docs.
2. Agents that need escalation or reassignment should also update `app/docs/alerts.md` if the situation is not self-resolvable.
3. The user asks Manager AI to "Check in".
4. Manager AI reads all agent progress docs and the alerts doc.
5. Manager AI identifies which agents appear to have completed their current assignments.
6. For those agents only, Manager AI rewrites their next-task docs with the new current assignment.
7. Manager AI reports:
   - which agents finished work
   - what they completed
   - what their next steps are
   - which agents received rewritten next-task docs
8. When safe assignable work exists, Manager AI should keep agents moving rather than leaving lanes idle.

- `app/client/src/features/layers/LayerPanel.tsx`
- `app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx`
- `app/client/src/lib/store.ts`
- `app/client/src/lib/queries.ts`
- `app/client/src/styles/global.css`
- `app/client/src/types/api.ts`
- `app/client/src/types/entities.ts`
- `app/server/src/config/settings.py`
- `app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs`
- `app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py`
- `app/server/tests/smoke_fixture_app.py`

If a file appears in both a lane section and the shared section, treat it as manual-review territory before commit.

## Shared-file coordination rules

### Frontend shell and cross-cutting state

Files:

- `app/client/src/features/app-shell/AppShell.tsx`
- `app/client/src/features/layers/LayerPanel.tsx`
- `app/client/src/features/inspector/InspectorPanel.tsx`
- `app/client/src/lib/store.ts`
- `app/client/src/lib/queries.ts`
- `app/client/src/styles/global.css`
- `app/client/src/types/api.ts`
- `app/client/src/types/entities.ts`

Rules:

- avoid broad refactors
- keep edits narrow and task-labeled in the final report
- always mention the file explicitly when it changed
- expect manual diff review before any commit
- if two agents touched the same file, do not auto-resolve or stage it blindly
- if ownership is unclear, hold the file for explicit consolidation review instead of forcing it into a domain commit

### Smoke and harness files

Files:

- `app/client/scripts/playwright_smoke.mjs`
- `app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py`
- `app/server/tests/smoke_fixture_app.py`

Rules:

- treat these as Connect-reviewed files even when feature agents add scenario assertions
- keep changes small and scoped to the target smoke phase
- list the exact smoke-related files in the final report
- expect manual diff review before commit
- do not let unrelated feature work piggyback into a smoke-harness commit
- if two agents touched the same harness file, do not auto-resolve without user instruction

### Mixed config

Files:

- `app/server/src/config/settings.py`

Rules:

- keep additions minimal and lane-specific
- note whether each setting belongs to geospatial, marine, webcam, or tooling work
- review carefully before commit because unrelated settings are easy to mix

## Commit-consolidation checklist

When the user later authorizes commits:

1. Run `git status --short`.
2. Group files by agent and logical task before staging anything.
3. Review diffs per group.
4. Stage only one logical task at a time.
5. Run task-specific validation for that group only.
6. Commit with a clear task-scoped message.
7. Repeat for the next task group.
8. Push only after the desired commits are complete and the remaining worktree state is understood.

Never:

- use `git add .`
- force push
- commit mixed-agent changes in one commit

## Commit examples by task group

- Connect AI commit
  - smoke harness and workflow docs only
- Gather AI commit
  - source registry docs and JSON only
- Data AI commit
  - public internet-information source services, fixtures, tests, and docs only
- Geospatial commit
  - environmental event backend, fixtures, client, and docs only
- Aerospace commit
  - aircraft and satellite files plus aerospace docs only
- Marine commit
  - marine files and marine docs only
- Features/Webcam commit
  - webcam operations files and webcam docs only

## Validation matrix

### Connect / tooling

- `python -m py_compile app/server/tests/run_playwright_smoke.py`
- docs diff review when docs-only
- no Playwright unless Connect is explicitly assigned

### Gather / source registry

- `python -m json.tool app/docs/data_sources.noauth.registry.json`
- no broad build unless source code changed

### Data / internet information

- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_rss_feed_service.py -q`
- focused Data AI backend tests for any new source slice
- `python -m compileall app/server/src`
- no frontend build unless client files changed

### Geospatial / environmental

- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_eonet_events.py -q`
- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_earthquake_events.py -q`
- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_planet_config.py -q`
- `python -m compileall app/server/src`
- `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`
- `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`

### Aerospace

- `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`
- `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`
- optional aerospace smoke only if Playwright is known-good elsewhere

### Marine

- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_marine_contracts.py -q`
- `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`
- `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`
- optional marine smoke only if Playwright is known-good elsewhere

### Features / webcam

- `python -m pytest app/server/tests/test_reference_module.py app/server/tests/test_webcam_module.py -q`
- `python -m compileall app/server/src app/server/tests/smoke_fixture_app.py`
- `cmd /c npm.cmd run lint`
- `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`

## Playwright environment note

- Known local classification: `windows-playwright-launch-permission`
- Current narrowed local cause for the focused aerospace smoke failure: `windows-browser-launch-permission`
- On this Windows machine, Playwright launch failure is an environment and tooling issue, not automatic feature failure.
- Non-Connect agents should not chase Playwright launch-permission issues unless explicitly assigned.
- Focused smoke phases may still be validated on another machine or environment later.
- A pre-assertion smoke failure on this machine does not mean the latest local client bundle is stale if `cmd /c npm.cmd run build` already passed.

## Recommended later commit order

1. Connect and tooling docs plus smoke-harness changes
2. Gather source-registry docs and JSON
3. Geospatial and environmental backend, fixtures, client, and docs
4. Aerospace scoped files
5. Marine scoped files
6. Features and webcam scoped files
7. Remaining shared-file reconciliations after manual review
